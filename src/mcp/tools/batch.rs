//! The `batch` MCP tool: executes a caller-supplied ordered list of note and
//! attachment operations in one call. Gated by `HATCHDOOR_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED`
//! only for the write-shaped items it contains — a read-only batch runs
//! whatever the instance's write posture.
//!
//! Every item delegates to the exact same `read`/`write` tool functions a
//! standalone call would use, so a batch behaves like N sequential single-tool
//! calls except for three deliberate relaxations: one round trip, best-effort
//! continuation past a failing item, and (issue #177) `expected_content_hash`
//! chaining between items in the same call that touch the same note — see
//! [`apply_hash_chain`].
//!
//! Chaining trusts this batch's own prior write, not the caller's own value,
//! so it must never be checked against a Vault an external writer could have
//! touched in between: [`batch_tool`] acquires each touched Vault's mutation
//! lock once and holds it for the rest of the call, rather than per item like
//! a standalone write does, closing that window instead of narrowing it.
//!
//! Note what the caller pays for that: while a batch runs, every other writer
//! to a Vault it has already written — the Web UI, the V1 HTTP adapter, another
//! MCP call — waits. A batch is capped at [`BATCH_MAX_WRITE_ITEMS`] writes for
//! this reason as much as for load.
//!
//! **One commit per batch** (#177) falls out of that same lock rather than any
//! Git handling here: this module writes Markdown exactly as the standalone
//! tools do, and a Vault's sync turn takes the same mutation lock, so no turn
//! can interleave with a batch and split it across commits. The turn then finds
//! every one of the batch's writes dirty together and commits them as one, which
//! `git::sync::tests::one_turn_commits_a_whole_batch_of_writes_as_a_single_commit`
//! asserts. The per-Vault turn is now the only synchronisation mechanism
//! (ADR-18, #185), so this holds for every synced Vault; the legacy
//! single-Vault sync path that could split a batch across commits no longer
//! exists.
