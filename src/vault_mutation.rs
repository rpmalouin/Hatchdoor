//! Shared-core, Vault-qualified mutations over authoritative Markdown.
//!
//! ADR-19 makes this the only seam a write adapter crosses. Everything the
//! HTTP and MCP adapters used to repeat around a `vault/write` primitive
//! lives here: resolving the Vault ID to a control block and refusing a
//! missing, disabled, or runtime-less Vault; the mutation capability check;
//! the per-Vault mutation lock; building the authoritative index off the
//! async runtime; resolving the slug to an entry; refusing a write to a path
//! this Vault's own exclusion patterns would make invisible; resolving the
//! archive prefix; running the blocking write off the async runtime; and
//! returning [`NoteWriteOutcome`] or a structured [`VaultOperationError`].
//! The adapters map that outcome or error onto their own wire shape and hold
//! nothing else.
//!
//! Since #186 every write primitive both surfaces expose runs through here:
//! the eleven note mutations, the four attachment mutations, and
//! write-capability discovery. The adapters kept only what is genuinely
//! theirs — parsing their own transport's arguments, and shaping this core's
//! typed outcome or structured error onto a status code or a JSON-RPC
//! failure. No index build, entry lookup, path refusal, or write-error
//! translation survives in either of them.
