//! Durable per-Vault operational state: the facts Hatchdoor must remember
//! about a Vault *between* processes, as opposed to its authoritative
//! configuration (`vault_registry`) or its disposable read model (`cache`).
//!
//! Today that is exactly one fact — when each Vault's last interval-arming
//! Git turn completed, and how it went — which is what lets
//! `git::ManagedGitScheduler` keep a Vault's configured poll interval across
//! a restart instead of restarting the countdown every time the process
//! does.
//!
//! This file is deliberately *not* the Vault registry. Losing it costs one
//! extra Git turn per Vault; losing the registry costs the collection. That
//! asymmetry is why the two are separate: the registry is revision-gated and
//! fails closed (an unreadable registry activates no Vaults at all), which is
//! right for configuration and credentials and wrong for bookkeeping a poll
//! can rewrite twice a day.
