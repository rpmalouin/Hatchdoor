# Drive /implement across the ready-for-agent queue, one ticket per fresh
# Claude Code process.
#
# /implement already selects its own work: with no argument it takes the oldest
# unassigned, unblocked `ready-for-agent` issue and stops when there is none.
# So this is not a scheduler, it is a driver loop with gates between runs.
# One process per ticket means context resets between tickets, which is the
# `/clear`-between-tickets rule the flow depends on.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/implement-queue.sh [max_tickets]
#
# Env:
#   BRANCH          branch the work lands on          (default: development)
#   LOG_DIR         per-ticket transcripts            (default: tmp/implement-queue)
#   TICKET_TIMEOUT  wall-clock cap per ticket         (default: 3h)
#   MAX_BUDGET_USD  optional spend cap per ticket     (default: unset)
#   MODEL           model alias for every ticket      (default: opus)
#   EFFORT          effort level                      (default: medium)
#
# Runs with --dangerously-skip-permissions: the agent can run any command
# without prompting. Halts the whole loop on the first failed gate.
#
# Every ticket, finished or failed, is recorded in a TSV ledger under LOG_DIR
# with the gate it died on, its wall time, cost and turn count, so a morning
# review shows what worked and what did not.
