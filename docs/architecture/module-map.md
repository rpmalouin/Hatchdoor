# Hatchdoor Module Map

## Purpose

This map defines collaboration boundaries for humans and coding agents. It
describes the repository as it exists today; it does not imply that every
listed boundary should become a package, crate, or feature directory.

Use this map together with
[`domain-collaboration-plan.md`](domain-collaboration-plan.md). A work
packet narrows this catalog to one task and declares any exceptions before work
starts.

## Boundary vocabulary

- **Owned paths:** implementation a module owner may change freely within the
  task.
- **Public contract:** the supported names, serialized shapes, or behavior that
  collaborators should rely on outside the module. This is narrower than every
  symbol that happens to be technically `pub` in Rust; current visibility does
  not enforce every documented boundary.
- **Coordination paths:** shared or composition files that may change only when
  the work packet lists them.
- **Consumed dependencies:** modules this boundary may call but does not own.
- **Invariant:** behavior that must remain true, usually backed by an ADR.

“Owner” means the owner of a work packet, not a permanent person or team.
Shared and composition files have no default task owner.

## Change rules

1. Internal changes may stay inside owned paths when the public contract and
   invariants do not change.
2. Public-contract changes must be declared and list affected consumers.
3. Coordination files are not implicitly writable because a module imports
   them.
4. Adapter code must not absorb domain behavior merely to avoid coordinating
   with the domain.
5. A full-stack feature can span multiple boundaries, but its work packet must
   enumerate each boundary and integration point.
6. When this map and the code disagree, stop and update the map or the work
   packet before expanding the diff.

## When to update this map

Update this map in the same change when:

- a production file is added, moved, or deleted;
- a file's owner, boundary kind, or shared/composition status changes;
- a supported public contract or invariant changes;
- a cross-module consumer, dependency, or coordination path is added or
  removed;
- the focused validation for a boundary changes.

Do not update the map for an ordinary internal edit that preserves all of the
above. Structural coverage can be checked mechanically, but contract and
invariant accuracy still require review.

Run the structural check after adding, moving, deleting, or reclassifying
production source files:

```bash
node scripts/check-module-map.mjs
```

The production inventory includes Rust `*.rs` files except standalone
`tests.rs`, plus frontend `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, and `*.css` files except
`*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, and `frontend/src/test/**`. Exact assignments outside
that production inventory are still checked for stale paths and duplicates.

## Backend

### Runtime composition

**Kind:** composition/shared.

**Owned paths:** none by default.

**Paths:**

- `src/lib.rs`
- `src/main.rs`
- `src/server.rs`
- `src/app_state.rs`
- `src/config.rs`
- `src/startup.rs`
- `src/vault_runtime.rs`
- `src/vault_runtime/tests.rs`
- `src/model_setup.rs`
- `src/vault_watcher.rs`

**Contract and responsibility:**

- `lib.rs` exposes the application modules to the main binary and auxiliary
  binaries.
- `main.rs` selects serve, model-prefetch, and container-healthcheck modes.
- `server.rs` is the HTTP composition root: it validates startup posture,
  constructs `AppState`, builds routes, and starts background work. Unsafe
  public startup without web authentication remains a refusal; its error
  includes a freshly generated, non-persisted recovery token for the operator
  to place in `.env`.
- `AppState` carries shared runtime state. Every field has a production
  reader, and each is one of: collection runtime (`vault_registry`, `vaults`,
  `vault_work`, `managed_git`, `startup_sqlite`, `embedder`,
  `runtime_embedder`, `mcp_tools_changed`), startup or posture
  (`legacy_migration_recovery`, `model_setup`, `model_setup_started`,
  `web_auth_enabled`, `demo_mode`, `startup`), or live configuration
  (`runtime_config`).
- `VaultCollectionRuntime` reconstructs disposable background turns at startup
  and, on process shutdown, stops new work and waits only for active
  background-turn and foreground-mutation safe boundaries.
  A `VaultControlBlock` also owns that Vault's `git::WriteLedger`, the one
  per-Vault handle both the mutation core and its Git turn already hold
  (#249). An in-place definition edit rotates the control block, and the
  ledger moves to the replacement alongside `prior_git`: its records describe
  writes already on disk and still uncommitted, so the rotation must not drop
  them.
  `AppState::vault_registry`, `AppState::vaults`, and
  `AppState::legacy_migration_recovery` expose the authoritative definition
  store, activated per-Vault control blocks, and safe legacy-recovery state to
  later shared-core adapters. `AppState::vault_work` and
  `AppState::managed_git` expose the same background-work coordinator and
  managed-Git scheduler `run_server()` wires into the one dispatch loop, so an
  HTTP adapter (`handlers/vaults.rs`) can reconcile a registry mutation into
  live runtime effects and request an immediate Git or Index turn without a
  second execution lane. The same loop dispatches each Index turn through the
  Vault-qualified Markdown scan and disposable snapshot publisher; the
  runtime's watcher intents re-enter that coordinator rather than creating a
  separate indexing path. An Index turn publishes in two passes: a Vault's
  structural rows first (`VaultSearchStatus::Browsable`), then the same Vault
  again once its vectors exist (`Ready`), so browsing does not wait on
  embedding. The structure pass is skipped for a Vault that already has a
  searchable generation, which keeps search answering across a rebuild.
  `AppState::runtime_config` supplies the immutable settings snapshot each
  reindex binds before it starts, including `HATCHDOOR_EMBED_LAYERS` for the
  per-Vault disposable candidate cache. `request_collection_reindex` is the
  collection-lane entry point an indexing-setting save uses: it requests one
  Index turn per active Vault through the same coordinator every other turn
  goes through, adding no second execution lane, and skips disabled Vaults,
  which have no active runtime.
  The one dispatch loop binds each turn's instance-wide Git commit identity
  from that turn's own settings snapshot (`git_author_defaults`) rather than
  from a value captured at startup, so a saved `HATCHDOOR_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` or
  `HATCHDOOR_GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` applies to the next Git turn of any Vault
  without its own commit identity, with no restart.
- `AppConfig` is the environment-derived deployment contract and interprets the
  live values from the startup `RuntimeConfig` snapshot. Its process-level
  Vault source is always the local `VAULT_PATH`; Git source identity and Git
  behavior belong only to registry Vault definitions. The removed,
  development-only `HATCHDOOR_VAULT_SOURCE`/`HATCHDOOR_VAULT_GIT_*` family is
  rejected explicitly rather than silently falling back to the local path.
  `HOST` accepts numeric IP literals plus the DNS-free `localhost` alias;
  accepted bracketed or bare IPv6 literals normalize structurally before bind,
  and unsupported hostnames fail with guidance rather than depending on DNS.
  The built-in `--healthcheck` selects a local target in the listener's address
  family, preserving the IPv6 listener path in the shell-free runtime image.
- `StartupTracker` exposes startup/model/indexing readiness.
- `VaultRuntime` and its serialized snapshot expose only the process startup's
  local source/mode, lifecycle phase, and derived non-Git capabilities. Git
  source, mode, and capabilities are derived per Vault by
  `VaultCollectionRuntime`; the startup-status adapter is not collection
  authority and never serializes a managed-Git source or mode.
- `VaultCollectionRuntime` reconciles only newer registry snapshots into zero,
  one, or many Vault-ID-keyed `VaultControlBlock` values; an older asynchronous
  reconciliation cannot replace or re-admit work after a newer collection is
  live. During activation, it derives Ready or Stale search capability from a
  retained participating SQLite snapshot before its reconstructed Index turn
  runs; a missing, nonparticipating, or unreadable snapshot remains
  Unavailable. Each enabled block owns its
  definition and resolved Markdown root, capability-specific activation/local
  content/search/Git/watcher status and errors, mutation and refresh locks, and
  independently cancellable watcher. Status changes and `reconcile()` advance a
  revisioned collection snapshot and publish a `VaultCollectionRevisionEvent`
  (`collection_revision`, the affected Vault IDs, and a broad
  `VaultChangeCategory` of `definition` or `status`) over
  `subscribe_revisions()`; a subscriber that misses an intermediate advance
  still learns the current revision from the watch channel's latest value and
  should refetch broadly rather than trust `vault_ids` as a complete history.
  Disabling, replacing, or disconnecting a block first revokes operation
  acceptance, publishes its cancellation signal, and stops its watcher,
  including through already-held handles; retirement waits for both its active
  coordinator turn and any already-admitted foreground mutation to reach their
  safe boundaries. The mutation lock also carries a per-Vault count of the
  foreground mutations that have taken it. `acquire_mutation` advances it under
  the lock; `acquire_mutation_for_index_reads` gives a background Index turn the
  same exclusion without advancing it, and returns the generation it observed;
  `blocking_retake_mutation_for_index` retakes the lock from a blocking thread
  and answers whether a mutation intervened, under that one acquisition, so the
  caller decides and acts without a window in between (issue #223, following the
  `request_if_idle` rule of issue #127). The count is never readable outside a
  holder of that lock, which is the only place its value means anything. Unchanged Vaults retain their control blocks when another
  definition changes; disabled definitions remain visible with no capabilities
  and no active runtime.
- `ModelSetup` owns local model selection, terms acceptance, download integrity,
  and persistent setup records. Once the embedder is installed, startup queues
  each active Vault through the collection Index coordinator; it does not run a
  second legacy single-Vault cache build. Startup becomes Ready after every
  active collection Vault's Index turn settles Ready.
- `spawn_vault_change_watcher` reports Vault-ID-qualified change intent through
  an independently cancellable handle. A qualifying filesystem event opens a
  quiet window that later events restart, bounded by a fixed ceiling
  (`WATCH_MAX_DEBOUNCE`): a sustained write burst reports intent no later than
  that ceiling after its window opened, instead of deferring it until the burst
  stops (#229). `run_server()`
  coalesces those intents through the shared `VaultWorkCoordinator` as Index
  requests. It is the only watcher: the transitional single-Vault adapter is
  gone with the rest of the legacy lane (#185).
- The one worker loop in `run_server()` takes the next coordinator position
  and hands it to `vault_executor::VaultWorkExecutor` — see the Vault work
  execution boundary below. The loop itself holds no readiness policy, no turn
  logic, and no per-turn dependency assembly.
- `reconcile_and_reconstruct` activates or deactivates a scheduler-tracked
  Vault's `ManagedGitScheduler` entry (and, on deactivation, releases any held
  checkout lease) alongside its coordinator admission — `ManagedGit`, and an
  `ExistingGit` Vault in `PullOnly`/`TwoWay` mode (issue #132), both driven by
  the same `VaultSource::managed_git_poll_interval` accessor; an `ExistingGit`
  Vault in `LocalHistory` mode has no remote and is never registered.
  `set_local_content_status` (mirroring
  `set_search_status`/`set_git_status`) republishes authoritative
  local-content availability after a Git turn, since `activation_snapshot`
  only stats `vault_path` once, at `reconcile()` time, before a managed
  checkout exists. `activation_snapshot`'s Git status defaults to `Pending`
  (an immediate first sync) for a genuinely new Vault or a
  disabled-to-enabled transition only; `reconcile()`'s non-retained-
  definition branch (an in-place edit to an already-active Vault) instead
  carries the retiring control block's actual current Git status and error
  through to the replacement (issue #97's reopening findings 1/2 follow-up)
  — otherwise every edit, not just an identity change, would force `Pending`
  and trigger an unwanted immediate real Git turn, bypassing an armed
  backoff or any other real status.
- Disabled runtime state becomes externally nonparticipating immediately;
  reconciliation retires the corresponding disposable snapshot after admitted
  work reaches its safe boundary and before its mutation response completes:
  disable removes participation and disconnect deletes only that Vault's rows.
  A short reconciliation phase lock makes state application and immediate
  coordinator drain/activation decisions atomic across competing revisions,
  but is released before any safe-boundary wait. A retirement failure is
  returned through the mutation boundary rather than reported as ordinary
  lifecycle success.
  A current-revision retry or restart converges disabled participation and
  removes cached Vault IDs absent from the registry; an older revision fences
  itself before those cache side effects.

**Consumed dependencies:** nearly every backend boundary. This is expected for
a composition boundary and is not a reason to introduce per-domain service
traits. Collection activation consumes redacted registry definitions and their
store-resolved local Markdown roots and does not read credentials. Git-turn
dispatch, which does read them, moved out of this boundary into the Vault work
execution boundary below (#197).

**Coordination rule:** any work packet touching these files must name the
specific field, route, startup phase, or integration being changed. Adding an
`AppState` field requires identifying every constructing test fixture.

**Invariants:**

- One binary serves HTTP, MCP, and the SPA over one shared core (ADR-02).
- Unsafe public/auth and demo configurations fail at startup (ADR-07).
- Model inference remains local and CPU-capable (ADR-04).
- Cache refresh preserves the disposable-read-model contract (ADR-01/06).
- The runtime image cannot assume a shell (ADR-12).

**Validation:** `cargo test server`, `cargo test app_state`,
`cargo test config`, `cargo test startup`, `cargo test model_setup`,
`cargo test vault_runtime`, `cargo test vault_executor`,
`cargo test vault_watcher`, followed by the full backend checks.

### Background work coordination

**Kind:** infrastructure/runtime scheduling.

**Owned paths:** `src/vault_work.rs`.

**Public contract:** `VaultWorkCoordinator` is the cloneable request side and
`VaultWorkWorker` is the unique execution side of one instance-wide in-memory
FIFO. `VaultWorkKind`, `VaultWorkRequest`, `ScheduleResult`, `VaultWorkOutcome`,
and `VaultWorkError` expose deterministic one-operation turns, request
coalescing, lifecycle rejection, and Vault-qualified returned outcomes. Index
work includes local embedding work; Git, commit, and repair remain distinct
operation kinds. `VaultWorkKind::Commit` is separate from `Git` rather than a
flavour of it (#267) precisely so the two coalesce independently: a purely
local commit costs nothing and can run on every change, while talking to a
remote costs a round trip and stays on the Vault's schedule, and folding them
together would let a due sync swallow a pending commit or the reverse.
A stopped worker returns `None` rather than waiting for discarded work.
`VaultWorkCoordinator::request_if_idle` is `request` for an automatic,
unattended producer: it admits a turn only when that kind is neither active
nor already pending for the Vault, and never adds the one guaranteed rerun
`request` gives an already-active turn. The check and the enqueue happen
under the one lock that owns the answer, so no second, separately tracked
notion of "is this Vault busy" exists to drift out of agreement with it
(issue #127, replacing the read-then-act `has_work` bridge added for #97's
reopening finding 1). `has_work` remains only as a `#[cfg(test)]`
observation. A user-driven request — a manual sync or retry — still uses
`request` and its guaranteed rerun.

**Consumed dependencies:** durable `VaultId` identity and Tokio notification.
The queue owns no Markdown, SQLite, Git, or lifecycle state.

**Consumers:** collection runtime reconstructs and drains work for lifecycle
transitions. `handlers/vaults.rs` reaches the coordinator only indirectly,
through `VaultCollectionRuntime::reconcile_and_reconstruct` after a registry
mutation, and directly through `ManagedGitScheduler::sync_now`/`retry_now` for
manual Git control and `VaultWorkCoordinator::request` for the one-Vault HTTP
refresh control — it never calls `drain_vault` itself. Runtime
composition dispatches every turn through `vault_executor` without additional
execution lanes; Repair remains separately owned. `git::ManagedGitScheduler`'s
`tick` is the one production caller of `request_if_idle`.

**Coordination paths:** `src/lib.rs` for the module export; runtime composition,
per-Vault watcher intent, cache refresh, Git lifecycle, and repair producers
when their owning packets integrate the coordinator.

**Invariants:** one Vault occupies at most one FIFO position; one operation runs
per turn; duplicate pending work coalesces and duplicate active work retains at
most one rerun, except through `request_if_idle`, which an automatic producer
uses to add none; remaining work returns to the tail; a returned failure completes
its turn and remains attributable to one Vault. The queue stays disposable and
adds no priorities, throttling, persistence, second lane, generic timeout, or
forced cancellation. Runtime lifecycle stops new work, discards queued work,
and waits only for an active turn's safe boundary; restart reconstruction uses
durable definitions and current local-content/Git status.

**Validation:** `cargo test vault_work`, the runtime-composition tests when a
consumer is integrated, and the full backend checks.

### Vault work execution

**Kind:** infrastructure/runtime execution.

**Owned paths:** `src/vault_executor.rs`, `src/vault_executor/tests.rs`.

**Public contract:** `VaultWorkExecutor` is where one admitted turn runs.
`run` executes exactly one `VaultWorkRequest`; `publish_outcome` applies what
the collection concludes from a finished turn. The executor is assembled once
at startup and binds one immutable `ConfigSnapshot` at the start of every
turn, so an admitted operation observes a single configuration view while a
saved setting still reaches the next turn without a restart — that is where
`git_author_defaults` (the instance-wide `HATCHDOOR_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`_EMAIL`
commit identity, overridden per Vault by
`git::config::resolve_commit_identity`) and `HATCHDOOR_EMBED_LAYERS` are read.
`collection_indexes_ready` is the startup readiness rule: startup becomes
Ready once every active Vault's Index turn has settled `Ready`, and an empty
collection is never Ready. Per ADR-13/ADR-18 this is a plain module with a
small public surface — no trait, no framework, no second execution lane.

- `dispatch_vault_index_turn` executes a `VaultWorkKind::Index` turn for one
  active Vault. It acquires that Vault's foreground mutation and refresh
  boundaries, builds an authoritative Markdown index and isolated candidate
  cache off the async runtime, publishes a structure-only participating
  snapshot before vector embedding on a first build so browsing does not wait
  for semantic search, atomically publishes only that Vault's complete shared
  snapshot, and publishes Ready, Stale, or Unavailable search state without
  changing another Vault's snapshot or status. A retained snapshot is marked
  stale for the duration of the rebuild, not only after a failure.
  The foreground mutation guard spans the read phase only — the authoritative
  scan, the structure pass, and every per-note content read — so a turn can
  never observe half of a multi-file foreground mutation, and is released at
  the read/embed boundary inside the candidate build. Holding it across the
  embedding pass parked every HTTP and MCP Markdown write behind a turn that
  was no longer reading anything, long enough for the caller's transport to
  give up on a write that had already landed (issue #223). The turn retakes
  the guard to publish and, when a foreground mutation completed while it was
  released, publishes that generation `VaultSnapshotFreshness::Stale` rather
  than `Fresh` and settles the runtime at `VaultSearchStatus::Stale` rather than
  `Ready` — the same pair `retained_snapshot_search_status` derives from that
  row after a restart. It still participates, still holds the search
  capability, and still answers search; the watcher's change intent has already
  armed the catch-up turn that makes it `Ready`. Retaking the guard happens
  while the cache's process-wide model epoch is held, so that acquisition is
  the one place the epoch waits on a per-Vault lock; the wait is bounded by one
  in-flight foreground mutation, and no mutation path takes the epoch, so the
  order cannot cycle. A turn
  requested before first-run model setup has installed the embedder defers
  with `embedder_not_ready` rather than wiping a valid cache.
- `dispatch_git_turn` executes a `VaultWorkKind::Git` turn. One shared
  shell owns everything the three Git-capable source kinds have in common —
  the per-Vault commit identity, the credential read, the mutation-lock hold,
  `spawn_blocking`, panic mapping, and outcome publication — and
  `plan_git_turn` supplies only what differs (issue #128). A `GitTurnPlan`
  names three variations: whether the turn holds
  `VaultControlBlock::acquire_mutation`, the error code a panic is reported
  as, and its `GitTurnWork` — `Leased` (the managed checkout, which cannot be
  built or run without that Vault's lease) or `Unleased` (an operator-owned
  checkout, which never takes one).
  - `ManagedGit`: obtains that Vault's checkout lease from
    `ManagedGitScheduler` (reused across turns for as long as the Vault stays
    active in this process — issue #95), then the mutation lock, runs
    `git::run_managed_git_turn`, and hands the lease back afterward. The lease
    is always acquired before the mutation lock, and nothing else in the
    codebase acquires it, so the two can never be taken in opposite orders.
  - `ExistingGit` in `PullOnly`/`TwoWay`: runs
    `git::run_existing_git_remote_turn` against the checkout that already
    exists at the Vault's `repository_path` — no checkout lease, see the Git
    synchronization boundary below for why `ManagedCheckoutLease` does not
    apply to an already-existing, operator-owned checkout — but under the same
    `acquire_mutation` hold as the managed-Git path, so a foreground Markdown
    write can never race either kind of turn's working-tree phases.
  - `ExistingGit` in `LocalHistory`: delegates to `plan_commit_turn`, because
    for a Vault with no remote the Git turn always was a commit and nothing
    else. Since #267 nothing production requests `VaultWorkKind::Git` for such
    a Vault, because activation, the watcher and manual control all ask for
    `Commit`, so this arm is a defensive alias rather than a live path.
  - `Local`: no Git turn at all; returns without publishing anything.

  Every branch that can commit is handed the Vault's `write_ledger()` so the
  commit it makes is named by the writes it records (#249).

  Both locked paths hold the mutation lock for the whole blocking turn
  (coarser than the legacy single-Vault task's fine-grained per-phase locking
  that released across network-only fetch/push) rather than only across
  working-tree-mutating phases; splitting `synchronize_managed_checkout` into
  independently lockable phases to match that finer discipline was judged a
  materially larger change than issue #96's reopening warranted.
- `dispatch_commit_turn` executes a `VaultWorkKind::Commit` turn: the local
  half of Git, on its own (#267). `plan_commit_turn` resolves the Vault's
  source and mode to `git::run_local_history_git_turn` (Local history, no
  mutation lock), `git::run_existing_git_commit_turn` (`ExistingGit` Two-way,
  mutation lock held because `prepare_two_way_worktree` stages from the whole
  checkout's status), or `git::run_managed_git_commit_turn` (`ManagedGit`
  Two-way, lease *and* mutation lock). Pull-only and `Local` plan nothing and
  return `Ok(())`: the first refuses writes and must leave its operator's own
  drift alone, the second has no Git. The turn itself runs through
  `run_planned_turn`, the same lease/mutation-lock/`spawn_blocking` shell a
  Git turn uses, extracted so neither kind has its own copy.
- `finish_commit_turn` publishes a commit turn's outcome, and is deliberately
  not `finish_git_turn` on three counts. It does not feed
  `ManagedGitScheduler`, because a commit is not a check of the remote and
  must not move the schedule that governs one. It does not request an Index
  turn, because the watcher change that asked for this commit already
  requested one, which is also what keeps a Vault whose Git is broken
  indexing normally. And a failure arms that Vault's `git::CommitCooldown`,
  so a standing failure costs one turn per cooldown window rather than one per
  save; a success clears it. Status publication is otherwise identical to a
  sync turn's: `Ready`, or `Unavailable` with the structured error and its
  affected paths. A commit that succeeds on a Vault whose *remote* sync is
  failing does clear that failure's status until the next scheduled sync
  republishes it. The alternative, a commit that can never clear a status it
  can set, was judged the worse lie.
- `publish_managed_git_turn_outcome` is the single publication path every Git
  turn exit reaches: Git status always, plus authoritative local-content
  availability on success (`activation_snapshot` only stats `vault_path` once,
  at `reconcile()` time, before a managed checkout exists), plus
  `ManagedGitScheduler::record_outcome` so the next attempt is armed. A Git
  failure never touches local-content status, so a Vault that already has a
  usable checkout stays browsable through a later sync failure. A successful
  turn with usable local Markdown requests that Vault's Index turn through the
  same coordinator.

**Consumed dependencies:** the work coordinator, the collection runtime and its
per-Vault control blocks, the Vault registry, the managed-Git scheduler and
turn functions, the disposable SQLite cache, the embedder, live configuration,
and the startup tracker — every one of them a field of `AppState`, which
`from_state` reads them off, so the composition root assembles nothing.
Managed-Git dispatch is the one place outside the registry that reads
plaintext credentials, through the crate-private `https_credentials`
accessor, for Git authentication only.

**Consumers:** `src/server.rs`'s single worker loop. Nothing else constructs a
`VaultWorkExecutor`; lifecycle tests in `src/vault_runtime/tests.rs` reach the
`#[cfg(test)]` `dispatch_vault_index_turn` seam directly.

**Coordination paths:** `src/lib.rs` exports the module; `src/server.rs` owns
the loop that calls it.

**Invariants:** one turn observes one settings snapshot; every Git turn exit
publishes through one path; the mutation lock is never acquired before the
checkout lease; an Index turn holds the foreground mutation guard across every
read it makes of the Vault and publishes a generation built across a foreground
mutation as stale; a returned failure is the turn's result, not a panic; no turn
starts a second execution lane or its own scheduler.

**Validation:** `cargo test vault_executor`, `cargo test vault_work`,
`cargo test vault_runtime`, `cargo test managed_task`, followed by the full
backend checks.

### Live configuration foundation

**Kind:** infrastructure/runtime state.

**Owned paths:** `src/runtime_config.rs`.

**Public contract:** `RuntimeConfig`, `ConfigSnapshot`, `ResolvedSetting`,
`SettingSource`, `Environment`, `SETTINGS_SCHEMA`, `live_settings_defaults`,
`settings_file_path`, `is_truthy`, and the versioned
`settings.json` file format. `RuntimeConfig::snapshot` gives one immutable,
lock-free configuration view to bind at the start of an operation;
`RuntimeConfig::save` serializes writes, persists first, then publishes the
new view. `RuntimeConfig::remove_stored` lets the one-time legacy migration
remove only settings already copied into the Vault registry, persisting before
publishing and leaving environment pins and unrelated values untouched.
`RuntimeConfig::validate_and_save` runs a caller-supplied decision
against the snapshot current at the moment the write lock is taken and only
persists on success, so validation and persistence serialize behind the same
lock (no separate read-then-write race). `ConfigSnapshot::required` is the one
accessor for "this key's value, or a descriptive error" that `src/config.rs`,
`src/mcp/config.rs`, and `src/git/config.rs` all call rather than each keeping
its own copy; `ConfigSnapshot::pinned_count` and `RuntimeConfig::settings_path`
support the startup pinned-setting log line and local-versioning `.gitignore`
setup respectively.

**Consumers:** runtime composition constructs the startup instance. The
settings HTTP API and the archive, index, MCP, and git live consumers bind a
snapshot in their respective capability boundaries. The legacy single-Vault
import reads one startup snapshot and removes migrated stored keys only after
the Vault registry commit succeeds.

**Coordination paths:** `src/lib.rs` exports the boundary. Runtime composition,
`src/config.rs`, `src/mcp/config.rs`, `src/git/config.rs`, and `src/app_state.rs`
consume it as live settings are integrated; no consumer may re-read process
environment variables after startup.

**Invariants:** environment values that are non-empty after trimming are
captured once and remain pinned above stored values. The store lives beside the
cache database unless the deployment-only override selects another path; it is
created with `0600` permissions on Unix. Corrupt, unsupported, and future
schemas fail with recovery guidance and are never overwritten.

**Validation:** `cargo test runtime_config`, followed by the full backend
checks.

### Vault collection registry

**Kind:** infrastructure/persistent domain state.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/vault_registry.rs`
- `src/vault_registry/tests.rs`

**Public contract:** `DEFAULT_VAULT_REGISTRY_PATH`,
`REGISTRY_SCHEMA_VERSION`, canonical `VaultId` generation and parsing,
`VaultRegistryStore`, immutable `VaultRegistrySnapshot` values, explicit
`VaultRegistryState::Ready` versus `Recovery`, structured recovery/error
types, redacted `VaultDefinition` projections, tagged `VaultSource` values for
local, existing-Git, and managed-Git Vaults, `VaultGitMode`, credential write
inputs/updates, validated `add`/`edit`/`enable`/`disable`/`disconnect`
operations, store-owned `vault_path` resolution for runtime consumers,
a remote-backed source's own `poll_interval_secs` (issue #97's reopening
finding 2: per-Vault, not scheduler-wide; `#[serde(default)]`s to 24h so a
registry record written before this field existed keeps loading under the
same `REGISTRY_SCHEMA_VERSION`, and `add`/`edit` reject a value below 60s,
mirroring `git::managed_task::BACKOFF_MAX`). Issue #132 gives `ExistingGit`
the same field (also `#[serde(default)]`, also floor-checked in
`PullOnly`/`TwoWay` — unchecked and unused in `LocalHistory`, which has no
remote), alongside `ManagedGit`'s. `VaultSource::managed_git_poll_interval`,
the read accessor `ManagedGitScheduler`/`handlers/vaults.rs` use to consume it,
the crate-private `is_safe_https_repository_url` validator shared with the
managed-checkout boundary, the crate-private `https_credentials` accessor
that returns plaintext credentials for one Vault ID (`None` for both an
absent Vault and one with none configured, so it cannot be used to probe
existence) for the managed-Git Git-turn dispatch boundary's internal use only
— never exposed to HTTP, MCP, or any other external-facing surface,
explicit confirmed-empty initialization for migration recovery, and the
versioned `/data/state/vaults.json` format. An absent file
is a complete revision-0 zero-Vault state and is not created by reads. Commits
are serialized by normalized registry path across all store handles in the
process, compare the expected persisted revision, increment it once, and
atomically replace the file with owner-only permissions. Corrupt, unsupported,
future-schema, or structurally invalid definition files expose no Vault records
and are never overwritten automatically.

Issue #130 gives `VaultRecord`/`VaultDefinition` two further optional fields,
both `#[serde(default)]` so a registry written before they existed keeps
loading under the same `REGISTRY_SCHEMA_VERSION` (the `poll_interval_secs`
precedent above): an `archive_folder`, normalized to a single-trailing-slash
form (e.g. `"Archive/"`) and read by `VaultDefinition::archive_folder`, and a
`commit_identity` (`VaultCommitIdentity { name, email }`, not a secret —
unlike credentials it round-trips through every projection unredacted) read
by `VaultDefinition::commit_identity`. Both are absent by default; the
instance-wide `HATCHDOOR_ARCHIVE_PREFIX` setting and
`HATCHDOOR_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`HATCHDOOR_GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` settings apply when
absent. The same issue makes `HttpsCredentials`' input username optional:
`normalize_credentials` substitutes the documented
`HTTPS_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME_PLACEHOLDER` constant when a caller supplies a
token alone, and validation now rejects only an empty token, not an empty
username.

**Consumers:** the legacy single-Vault import consumes the registry load, add,
and confirmed-empty initialization contracts. Runtime composition loads the
registry after migration and `VaultCollectionRuntime` consumes its safe
projections and resolved paths; the Vault work executor's managed-Git Git-turn
dispatch (`dispatch_git_turn`) is the one consumer of the crate-private
`https_credentials` accessor, and also resolves `commit_identity` through
`git::config::resolve_commit_identity` before every Git turn. `handlers/vaults.rs`
is the first HTTP consumer of the `add`/`edit`/`enable`/`disable`/`disconnect`
mutation contracts and of `load` for authenticated discovery, including its
explicit `Recovery` state. `ManagedGitScheduler::activate` (runtime
composition's reconcile loop) and Vault collection management's manual
sync/retry and credential-replacement-retry controls consume
`VaultSource::managed_git_poll_interval`. `AppState::vault_archive_prefix`
(Vault mutation's three archive call sites: `handlers/vault_content.rs`,
`handlers/vault_write.rs`, `mcp/tools/write.rs`) consumes `archive_folder`,
falling back to `AppState::runtime_archive_prefix` when absent. Both the HTTP and MCP surfaces reach these
writes through Vault collection management, which owns the
`create_vault`/`edit_vault` request and credential-patch types they share.
Frontend, cache, and search adapters remain separately owned later packets.

**Coordination paths:** `src/lib.rs` exports the boundary; `src/server.rs` and
`src/app_state.rs` construct and retain it; `/data/state` deployment
persistence and later management adapters require their own declared work
packets.

**Invariants:** the registry is the sole Hatchdoor-owned Vault-definition
authority; immutable IDs are UUID v4 map keys; revision conflicts save nothing;
names are unique case-insensitively; canonical Vault paths never overlap and
disabled definitions continue reserving them; identity-bearing changes require
a disabled definition plus explicit same-Vault confirmation; readable
non-writable directories remain valid; disconnect deletes no files or Git
state; HTTPS credentials persist only in the private registry record and never
appear in projections, debug output, errors, status, or repository URLs;
recovery retains the original bytes; Vault contents remain authoritative
Markdown and SQLite remains disposable (ADR-01); the store adds no service,
framework, or speculative trait (ADR-02/13); filesystem behavior assumes no
runtime shell and remains usable by the rootless image (ADR-12).

**Validation:** `cargo test vault_registry`,
`node scripts/check-module-map.mjs`, followed by the full backend checks.

### Vault durable runtime state

**Kind:** infrastructure/persistent operational state.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/vault_runtime_state.rs`
- `src/vault_runtime_state/tests.rs`

**Public contract:** `RUNTIME_STATE_SCHEMA_VERSION`,
`RUNTIME_STATE_FILE_NAME`, `VaultRuntimeStateStore` (`new`,
`beside_registry`, `last_git_turn`, `record_git_turn`, `forget`),
`GitTurnRecord`, `GitTurnOutcome`, and `format_timestamp` — the RFC 3339 UTC
seconds-precision shape shared with `vault_management`, so a timestamp reads
identically whether it came from this file or from the live countdown. The
versioned `state/vault-runtime.json` format: one Git-turn record per Vault,
keyed by Vault ID, each holding the wall-clock `completed_at`, the `outcome`,
and a `code` and already-redacted `message` written for a failure — carried so
a restarted instance republishes the same sentence the previous process showed
rather than falling back to a generic one. `GitTurnOutcome::Failed` owns those
two details, so no caller above the file boundary can hold a failure without
them; a stored record missing either still loads, with the fallback applied
once, where the file is read.

**Consumers:** Git synchronization (`git::ManagedGitScheduler`, which reads a
Vault's record once per activation and writes one after every
interval-arming turn), the runtime composition root, which resolves the store
beside the registry, and Vault collection management, for `format_timestamp`
alone. No HTTP, MCP, or frontend consumer reads this file directly — a status
read renders the scheduler's in-memory clock instead.

**Invariants:** this file records disposable operational state, never
configuration or credentials, and carries no revision or concurrency contract
of its own — a poll can rewrite it without disturbing the Vault collection or
a client's `expected_registry_revision`. Losing it costs one extra Git turn
per Vault, so a missing, unreadable, or unparseable file reads as "no record"
and never blocks startup; a file whose `schema_version` exceeds this build's
is read as "no record" and, unlike a corrupt one, is never overwritten, so a
downgrade cannot destroy a newer build's state. Records are written whole
through the parent directory's creation, hold owner-only content by way of the
same state directory, and only interval-arming outcomes are stored — a
transient failure's backoff stays process-local by design. Vault contents
remain authoritative Markdown and SQLite remains disposable (ADR-01); the
store adds no service, framework, or speculative trait (ADR-02/13).

**Validation:** `cargo test vault_runtime_state`,
`node scripts/check-module-map.mjs`, followed by the full backend checks.

### Legacy single-Vault import

**Kind:** infrastructure/migration boundary.

**Owned paths:** `src/vault_migration.rs`.

**Public contract:** `LegacyMigrationInput`, `LegacyMigrationOutcome`,
`LegacyMigrationRecovery`, `LegacyMigrationError`, `migrate_legacy_vault`, and
`start_with_no_vaults`. Inspection returns a deterministic no-deployment,
existing-registry, imported, or stable `legacy_migration_required` recovery
outcome. Any existing registry, including an intentionally empty one,
permanently suppresses legacy import. A safe import copies legacy exclusions,
Git behavior, credentials, and commit identity into the ordinary Vault
definition; the retired write-debounce value has no successor. A safe import of
a plain `Local` source whose directory holds no Markdown writes the starter
Vault into it (`vault::seed_new_vault`) after the registry commit and before
the collection runtime activates it, so a first boot on an empty `VAULT_PATH`
opens on the welcome notes; a Git-backed legacy deployment is never seeded, and
a directory that already holds Markdown is left untouched. Confirmed Start
with no Vaults writes an ordinary revisioned zero-Vault registry.

**Consumers:** startup runtime composition calls this isolated adapter before
opening the disposable cache and activating Vault runtimes. Safe imports become
ordinary enabled definitions; migration or environment-cleanup recovery activates no Vault and remains in
`AppState` for later setup/management surfaces.

**Coordination paths:** `src/lib.rs` exports the boundary; `src/server.rs`
turns migrated or now-ignored per-Vault environment keys into a restricted,
non-secret startup recovery response after a committed import or existing registry;
`docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `README.md`, and
`docs/migrations/legacy-single-vault.md` document and persist the registry
required by the migration contract.

**Consumed dependencies:** the Vault collection registry owns definitions and
atomic persistence; live configuration owns precedence and stored-setting
cleanup; `src/config.rs` owns exclusion parsing; the cache boundary owns
read-only legacy-schema recognition; `git2` and filesystem metadata provide
inspection only.

**Invariants:** detection requires positive legacy evidence, so a fresh empty
default does not migrate. Registry persistence completes before migrated
settings or a recognized disposable cache are removed. Inspection never seeds,
moves, edits, clones, pulls, commits, pushes, checks out, or merges legacy
content or Git state. Unsafe conversion leaves all legacy state unchanged and
returns recovery. After a successful registry commit, non-empty
`HATCHDOOR_EXCLUDE` and `HATCHDOOR_GIT_*` environment values are named in a
restricted recovery UI until removed and the process is restarted; health and
the web shell remain reachable, but Vault runtime activation and mutation are
withheld. `VAULT_PATH` remains valid deployment configuration.
The development-only managed-startup variable family is rejected before it can
silently select another source. Markdown remains authoritative and downgrade
across the registry cutover is unsupported.

**Validation:** `cargo test vault_migration`, `cargo test vault_registry`,
`cargo test runtime_config`, `cargo test cache`,
`node scripts/check-module-map.mjs`, followed by the full backend checks.

### Web authentication

**Kind:** infrastructure/security.

**Owned paths:** `src/auth.rs`.

**Public contract:** `WebToken`, `WebOrLiveMcpToken`, `require_web_token`,
`require_web_or_live_mcp_token`, and `require_web_or_live_mcp_read_token`. Both
attachment middlewares bind the MCP token from the current runtime snapshot
instead of retaining a token captured at startup, so disabling MCP at runtime
immediately revokes that credential; web-token admission is independent of MCP
state in both.

The upload middleware accepts the MCP token only while MCP *and* MCP writes are
enabled, so a write-mode disable revokes upload capability. The asset-read
middleware accepts it whenever MCP is enabled, so that `get_attachment`'s
default `download_url` is fetchable by the client that holds it (#176).

Admission on the MCP token is **not** equivalent to admission on the web token,
and two constraints carried by the read middleware are what keep it from
widening that credential's reach. Over `/mcp` an MCP client reading attachment
bytes is bounded by `HATCHDOOR_MCP_MAX_BASE64_BYTES` and by #171's tool quota
and concurrency caps; the asset route's own bound is far larger (64 MiB) and it
sits outside the `/mcp` transport, so an unconstrained `download_url` would be a
way around both. Therefore an MCP-admitted request (a) spends the same quota and
concurrency budget as a tool call, against the *same* `RateLimiter` instance the
transport uses — obtained via `HatchdoorMcpTransport::limiter`, so the two
channels share one budget rather than getting one each — answering `429` with
`Retry-After` when exhausted, and (b) carries the `McpAssetRead` request
extension, which `vault_content.rs`'s asset handler reads to apply
`max_base64_bytes` as the response ceiling before the file is buffered. A
web-token request carries no extension and keeps the route's own bound.

The read middleware keeps `require_web_token`'s `access_token` query fallback
for the *web* token alone, since the browser reaches assets through `<img>` tags
and download navigations; the MCP token is header-only, keeping it out of the
request trace span. It is layered on exactly the condition `vaults_v1` uses — a
web token configured, and not demo mode — so a deployment with no web token
keeps serving assets openly and enabling MCP never demands a credential the
browser has never held.

**Consumers:** `server.rs` and protected HTTP routes.

**Consumed dependencies:** live runtime configuration and `McpConfig` parsing
for per-request attachment authorization.

**Coordination paths:** `src/server.rs`, `src/config.rs`, frontend
`frontend/src/api/api.ts`, and any route whose authentication requirements
change.

**Invariants:** constant-time token comparison, no token logging, and deliberate
query-parameter fallback for browser contexts that cannot set headers (ADR-08).

**Validation:** `cargo test auth` and server/router tests.

### HTTP wire types

**Kind:** shared contract.

**Owned paths:** `src/api_types.rs`.

**Public contract:** the shared serialized request and response structures
defined here, including resolve, recent, stats, and graph shapes.
Endpoint-local wire types remain owned by their handlers, notably write types
in `handlers/vault_write.rs` and diagnostics types in
`handlers/diagnostics.rs`. The legacy `RefreshResponse` is retired along with
the scope-less refresh surface; Vault-scoped refresh control remains
separately owned.

**Consumers:** `src/handlers/**` and the manually corresponding frontend types
in `frontend/src/types.ts` or feature-local client types.

**Coordination rule:** serialized field changes are interface changes. The work
packet must identify backend handlers, frontend consumers, and compatibility
expectations. Additive response fields are usually compatible but still require
the frontend contract to be checked.

**Validation:** affected backend handler tests, affected frontend consumer
tests, and frontend typecheck. Rust and TypeScript wire shapes are manually
synchronized; no automated cross-language schema check currently exists.

### Vault read model and filesystem interpretation

**Kind:** product capability/domain core.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/vault.rs`
- `src/vault/exclude.rs`
- `src/vault/index.rs`
- `src/vault/layers.rs`
- `src/vault/links.rs`
- `src/vault/paths.rs`
- `src/vault/seed.rs`
- `src/vault/types.rs`
- `src/vault/tests.rs`

**Public contract:** the intentional re-exports from `src/vault.rs`, notably
`VaultIndex`, note/tree/link types, path normalization helpers, layer and
exclusion types, `is_servable_asset`, `split_wikilink_asset_body`,
`seed_empty_vault`, and `seed_new_vault`.
`seed_new_vault` is the single decision point for which newly defined Vaults
receive the starter notes — a `Local` source whose directory holds no Markdown,
judged with that Vault's own exclude matcher so trashed notes do not count —
shared by the two callers that create Vault definitions (`handlers/vaults.rs`'s
creation route and `vault_migration.rs`'s one-time import), so the rule cannot
drift between them; it reports `SeedError` rather than deciding what a failure
means, which is each caller's call. `VaultIndex`
additionally carries an asset index (`asset_paths`, `assets_by_name`) filled by
the same walk that collects the Markdown files, and `resolve_asset` reads it:
Obsidian's default link format writes an attachment embed as a bare filename and
resolves it by searching the vault, so a purely note-relative reading broke every
embed in a vault using one top-level attachments folder (#158). `is_servable_asset`
is shared with the read core's contained-resource seam
(`src/vault_read/assets.rs`), so resolution can never name a path the asset
route or the MCP `get_attachment` tool would refuse.

**Consumed dependencies:** filesystem traversal and parsing; `cache::parse`
currently supplies content hashing to the index and, since #248, the shared
Markdown code-region scanner (`for_non_code_line`) the link reader uses to skip
fenced code blocks and inline code spans.

**Consumers:** cache population, handlers, MCP reads, write coordination,
watching, and application startup.

**Coordination paths:** `src/cache/**`, `src/vault_watcher.rs`,
`src/api_types.rs`, and adapters when a public vault type changes.

**Invariants:**

- Markdown files remain authoritative (ADR-01).
- Excluded/noise paths do not enter the index.
- Layer markers remain visible to classification even under broad exclusions.
- A note remains addressable while its layer is reported to callers.
- A backslash before a wikilink's alias pipe is syntax rather than part of the
  target, so `[[Note\|alias]]` - the form a Markdown table cell forces - names
  the same note as `[[Note|alias]]` in the link graph and in wikilink
  resolution. `src/vault/paths.rs` is the single home for that split, shared
  with the write layer's rewriters, and no escape reaches
  `normalize_link_target`, which would read it as a path separator (#252).

**Validation:** `cargo test vault` and the full backend checks.

### Vault mutation

**Kind:** product capability/domain core; safety-critical.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/vault/write.rs`
- `src/vault/write/assets.rs`
- `src/vault/write/attachments.rs`
- `src/vault/write/frontmatter.rs`
- `src/vault/write/fs_ops.rs`
- `src/vault/write/notes.rs`
- `src/vault/write/paths.rs`
- `src/vault/write/rewrites.rs`
- `src/vault/write/types.rs`
- `src/vault/write/tests.rs`

**Public contract:** write functions and result/error types re-exported from
`src/vault.rs`, including note CRUD-by-move, section/edit primitives,
shallow frontmatter merge (`update_note_frontmatter`), attachment
operations, allowed attachment extensions, `WriteOutcome`, and `WriteError`.
`frontmatter.rs` is internal to the layer: `edit_frontmatter_block` is a plain
`pub(super)` function, deliberately not a trait or an extension point
(ADR-13), and its second caller will be the vault-wide tag rename (#242).

**Consumed dependencies:** vault index/types, the local filesystem, and
`cache::parse` for content hashing, frontmatter span parsing, and the shared
Markdown code-region scanner (`for_non_code_line`, `parse_fence_marker`) that
keeps every rewriter's idea of a code block identical to the indexer's. It
also consumes the vault read model's wikilink body splits
(`split_wikilink_note_body`, `split_wikilink_asset_body`), so a rewriter and
the link graph can never disagree about where a target ends (#252).

**Consumers:** the Vault-qualified mutation core (`src/vault_mutation.rs`),
which since #186 is the sole caller of every write primitive. The one
exception is `list_note_attachments`, a read that lives here for its path
handling and is called by the MCP `list_note_attachments` tool through the
core's own `write_operation_error` translation.

**Coordination paths:** `src/vault_mutation.rs`, Git write records, frontend
write API/types, and configuration for archive or upload limits.

**Invariants:**

- All HTTP and MCP mutations use this shared layer (ADR-03).
- Optimistic concurrency uses the expected content hash.
- A conditional write commits by exchanging its temporary sidecar with the
  destination, so past that exchange the outcome a caller is told depends on
  whether the undo put the old bytes back. An undo that succeeds reports the
  original failure; one that cannot run leaves the write committed and
  unverified, and reports `recovery_required` rather than a plain failure, so
  no caller is told a write did not land when it did. A `recovery_required`
  message is the one write failure that reaches an API client unsanitized, so
  it names the note and its sidecar without the directories above them.
- A write that names part of a note edits that part and leaves every other byte
  alone (ADR-22). `update_note_frontmatter` rewrites only the lines its named
  keys own, so key order, one-line versus block lists, indentation, quoting,
  comments, and blank lines survive untouched; a replaced value inherits the
  shape its author used, and a new key is appended with any list on one line.
  A named key that cannot be located and replaced unambiguously refuses the
  whole call by name. The edited block is then reparsed and compared against the
  intended merge before anything reaches disk, which is the backstop for a block
  the key scanner reads differently from a YAML parser, an indented top-level
  mapping being the example, and the one case where an unnamed key can refuse a
  call (#257). Whole-content writes
  (`update_note`) keep their line-ending and trailing-newline normalisation;
  ADR-22 constrains partial writes only.
- Delete is recoverable trash; archive is move-based (ADR-11).
- A rewritten backlink keeps the form its author wrote, and a link that
  resolved before a move still resolves after it: the bare-title form is used
  only while the new title names exactly one note, and falls back to the full
  path otherwise (#235). An escaped alias pipe is part of that form: the
  rewrite retargets `[[Old\|alias]]` and hands the escape back, so the table
  cell it protects stays valid Markdown (#252).
- The note being renamed or moved is one more note holding links to the target,
  so its own body follows that same rule (#254). Its rewrite is keyed to the
  note's destination path, because the note has already moved by the time
  rewrites are applied, and it composes with the stationary-asset rewrite that
  targets the same path rather than replacing it. `rewritten_notes` still
  counts only the other notes, so a rename whose one stale link is the note's
  own reports zero. Delete leaves the trashed body's self-link as written.
- An asset travels with its note only from inside the note's own folder (#225),
  and an occupied destination refuses the whole write - except where that
  destination is the asset's own file, which is a move to nowhere rather than a
  collision: no move and no rewrite are planned for it, and `moved_assets`
  counts what actually moved (#238).
- Paths remain within the canonical vault root.
- The upload allowlist is ingest policy only. `import_attachment` and the HTTP
  upload route apply it; `move_attachment`, `rename_attachment` and
  `delete_attachment` do not, because they act on bytes the Vault already
  stores (#247). What those three refuse instead is a Markdown target, which
  belongs to the note tools, and anything under `.git`, which is the Vault's
  own repository rather than content. Any non-Markdown file with an extension
  counts as an asset reference for listing and for note-move travel; an
  extension is still required, since that is what separates a file from a
  wikilink to a note, and the existing existence check is what keeps a dotted
  note title out of the plan.
- What the Vault excludes as noise is not an attachment either, and since #247
  `reject_noise_write` is applied to an attachment operation's source as well
  as its destination. The upload allowlist was the only thing keeping these
  tools out of `.obsidian/`; that protection now comes from the policy the
  Vault already states.
- Layer marker and excluded/noise writes remain protected at adapter and domain
  boundaries as applicable.
- Concurrent writes to one Vault are serialized through
  `VaultControlBlock::acquire_mutation`, a genuine per-Vault lock and the only
  vault write lock there is — the instance-wide `AppState::vault_write_lock`
  went with the legacy Git-sync task (#185). Since #186 that lock is taken in
  exactly one place, `src/vault_mutation.rs`, on behalf of both surfaces; the
  known gap #103 opened is closed.

**Validation:** `cargo test vault::write`, `cargo test vault_mutation`, and
the full backend checks.

### Vault-qualified read projections

**Kind:** product capability/domain core.

**Owned paths:** `src/vault_read.rs`, `src/vault_read/assets.rs`, `src/vault_read/query.rs`.

**Public contract:** `VaultReadCore`, `BrowseSurface`, explicit `VaultScope`,
the common `VaultReadProjection` envelope, participant state/error types, and
Vault-qualified exact-note, tree, statistics, graph, and recent-note
projections. `BrowseSurface` names which layer surface a caller may read.
`Everything` is the established behavior and stays the default: a layer demotes
a Note from the default *search* surface only, and an operator still reaches it
by slug, in the explorer, and on the graph. `DefaultOnly` is demo mode's clamp
(#109), selected through `BrowseSurface::for_demo_mode` and applied by both
`VaultReadCore::on_surface` and `search::vault_scoped::VaultSearchCore::on_surface`:
a demo has no operator and no layer toggle, so a demoted Note is withheld from
exact reads, links, resolve, and download (as an ordinary not-found, so
withheld is indistinguishable from absent), and `BrowseSurface::restrict` drops
its rows from a published snapshot before any projection reads it, covering
tree, graph, recent, statistics, query, and a surviving search hit's outbound
links. A
link is dropped when either endpoint is withheld, since a surviving edge would
name the hidden Note. `BrowseSurface::layer_selection` parses the caller's raw
comma-separated layer tokens and clamps a restricted surface's selection to the
default surface, so the `layers=` query is not an escape hatch; it and
`VaultScope::parse` are the one implementation both adapters use, together with
the `clamp_recent_limit`/`clamp_search_limit`/`clamp_search_per_note_cap`
bounds and the shared `note_not_found` failure (#188). `statistics_detail` (#137) is the exact-read counterpart to the
lean collection `statistics` projection: it returns `VaultQualifiedStats`
directly (never wrapped in `VaultReadProjection`, like `exact_note`), scoped
to exactly one Vault via `collection`'s `VaultScope::One` gating, computing
every legacy `VaultStatsResponse` field from the same published snapshot
`statistics`/`trees`/`graphs` read rather than the single-Vault-shaped SQL
cache tables the retired scope-less statistics query read. `VaultScope`
serializes as the flat scalar
`docs/migrations/vault-scoped-clients.md`'s envelope documents — the Vault
ID's canonical text for `One`, or the literal `"all"` — mirroring exactly what
a caller passes as the `scope` path segment, rather than serde's derived
externally-tagged shape. `resolve_wikilinks` resolves every target in a batch
against one
authoritative-index build, rather than one build per target. `resolve_batch`
generalizes it to note *and* asset targets over that same one build (#158),
taking the embedding note's Vault-relative directory because an asset target
resolves relative to the note that names it; assets are returned as
Vault-relative paths, since an asset has no slug. The browse surface does not
gate them: assets carry no layer, and an embed only resolves for a caller
already reading the note that contains it. `vault_directory`
resolves one Vault's local Markdown directory under the same
not-found/disabled/unavailable gating as exact reads (reusing
`VaultControlBlock::ensure_accepting_operations`, widened to `pub(crate)`,
rather than re-deriving that check), without building a full index, for
adapters that only need the path (contained asset/attachment/download
serving); it additionally confirms the directory exists on disk, since a
managed-Git Vault can be enabled and accepting operations before its checkout
has materialized, and reports that as the same retryable
`vault_read_unavailable` code an exact-note read's index build would rather
than a caller discovering an unrelated raw filesystem error later.
`asset_on_surface` applies the complete demo-readable policy to a contained
asset's Vault-relative path: it must occur in the authoritative index's asset
catalog (which has already applied configured and built-in noise exclusions)
and survive `BrowseSurface` layer selection. A demo therefore cannot bypass
its default-only Note surface by requesting a demoted, noise, or excluded asset
directly; ordinary `Everything` reads retain the legacy contained-asset
behavior.
`query_notes` (#274) selects the Notes whose tags, path, and frontmatter
properties satisfy every stated condition, restoring the capability the
multi-Vault rewrite retired. It selects rather than ranks, and nothing in
`src/vault_read/query.rs` reaches the retrieval path: conditions are tested
against the published snapshot's structural rows, so a Vault whose generation
carries no vectors answers in full and there is no score to order by. The
condition vocabulary is `NoteQueryCondition` — a tag (nested-aware), a
Vault-relative `path_prefix` (segment-aware and case-insensitive), or a
property tested by one `PropertyOperator` — and the `NoteQueryResponse` rows are
Vault-qualified, projected with the properties the caller named, ordered by
path then Vault then slug, and flagged `truncated` when the clamped `limit`
held Notes back. `CompiledQuery::compile` validates the whole query before any
Vault is resolved, so a malformed one is the `invalid_query` refusal at every
scope; the two shared tag primitives it normalises and matches with,
`search::normalize_tag_path` and `search::tag_matches`, live in the shared
search vocabulary so a query and the `#tag` search shorthand cannot disagree
about what a nested tag is. The `limit` is clamped inside `compile` rather than by each adapter, so a
caller cannot reach the core with a zero limit and be told its complete answer
was truncated.
`exact_note_frontmatter` and `note_attachments` are the surface-gated
counterparts of the frontmatter and attachment-listing reads the MCP tools used
to answer from a raw index build of their own (#188); both return `Ok(None)`
for a Note this surface withholds, indistinguishable from an absent one.
`VaultNoteFrontmatter` carries `content_hash` (#227), computed by
`cache::parse::content_hash` — the one canonical helper every write receipt and
every `expected_content_hash` comparison uses — over the content the
frontmatter read has already loaded. It is therefore identical to the hash
`exact_note` reports for that Note at that instant and costs no extra
filesystem read, and it is not optional: the hash covers the whole file, so a
Note with no frontmatter block still has one to report.
`vault_capabilities` reports one Vault's own mutation/sync posture under the
same gate, for an adapter describing a Vault rather than reading it.
`contained_asset` is the single home for the contained-resource policy both
surfaces answer on: the Vault gate, path containment against the canonical
root, the servable-extension allow-list, the content-type table, the response
bound, and `asset_on_surface`. Its primitives stay private to
`src/vault_read/assets.rs`; adapters see only `ResolvedAsset`,
`AssetPathError` (which owns each outcome's stable `code` and message, while
the HTTP status stays in `handlers/assets.rs`), `AssetReadError`, and
`asset_download_path`. `VaultResolveResponse` is the wikilink-resolution
projection, relocated here from `handlers/vault_content.rs` in #188 so both
adapters serialize the same type. `VaultReads` is the owned handle that runs a
read off the async runtime (`OffloadedReadError` separates the Vault's own
structured failure from a blocking task that never completed), so neither
adapter re-implements the clone-and-`spawn_blocking` prologue — MCP had drifted
into running index builds and filesystem reads straight on a tokio worker.
`VaultReadError::public_code`/`into_operation_error` give one translation from
the core's internal spellings to the stable `{code, message, vault_id?,
retryable}` object both surfaces report.
`trees` takes a `TreeScope` alongside the Vault scope (#192): the folder it
starts from, how far below it descends, and whether Notes appear at all, with
`TreeScope::default()` the whole Vault every caller read before. The narrowing
lives here rather than in an adapter, so the HTTP route — which passes the
default and always will, since the explorer draws the entire tree — and
`get_tree` share one implementation. A folder the Vault does not have is the
non-retryable `folder_not_found`, never an empty tree, so a mistyped name and
an empty folder stay distinguishable; under `all` it lands on the participant,
the same route any other non-participation takes, which is why `collection`'s
per-Vault projection is fallible — and `trees` raises it back to a refusal when
no Vault produced a tree, so the blur does not simply move up to the collection.
Zero enabled Vaults stays the empty projection it has always been. `VaultExplorerFolder` reports `note_count`
(the Notes directly inside it) and marks `truncated` when `max_depth` held it
back; `VaultExplorerNote` carries no `vault_id`, because the `VaultTree` around
it already does. Flat projections that mix Vaults in one list —
`VaultRecentNote`, search hits — keep theirs.
`exact_note_for_download` returns a Note together with its containing
directory from one Vault control-block fetch — required whenever a caller
needs both, since a concurrent Vault edit reconciles a *replacement* control
block rather than mutating the current one in place, so two independent
`exact_note`/`vault_directory` calls could otherwise observe different Vault
generations. The private `control_and_index` seam shares the
control-block-then-index-build sequence between `authoritative_index` and
`exact_note_for_download` so the two cannot diverge on identical failure
conditions.

**Consumed dependencies:** the Vault runtime's authoritative per-Vault index,
the shared cache's published Vault snapshot seam, existing Vault note/link
types, and Runtime Search's two tag primitives (`normalize_tag_path`,
`tag_matches`) for a query's tag condition. That last one is a dependency on
the shared search *vocabulary*, not on retrieval: nothing here calls
`VaultSearchCore`.

**Consumers:** `handlers/vault_content.rs` (exact note/link/resolve reads,
`vault_directory`, and the contained-asset route),
`handlers/vault_collection_reads.rs` (the collection-read projections `trees`,
`statistics`, `graphs`, `recently_modified`), and — since #188 — `mcp/tools/read.rs`
for every one of the Vault read tools (`mcp::tools::READ_OPS`). All three are thin adapters with
no read domain logic of their own. The core has no adapter or route ownership.

**Coordination paths:** `src/cache/vault_snapshots.rs` for read-only
Vault-qualified snapshot rows, `src/cache/mod.rs` for the crate-private seam,
`src/vault_runtime.rs` for the authoritative exact-read index boundary.

**Invariants:**

- Exact reads inspect the requested Vault's Markdown directory; SQLite remains
  a disposable projection (ADR-01).
- Every selected or returned note identity includes an immutable Vault ID; no
  default or sole-Vault inference exists.
- One-Vault snapshots are explicit about stale availability, unavailable
  snapshots never become empty data, and all-Vault reads preserve participant
  status and Vault grouping.
- A Vault whose generation carries no vectors reads as
  `VaultParticipantState::NotSearchable` in semantic search only; browsing,
  keyword and tag reads use the same structural rows and report `Fresh`. It is
  never reported `Unavailable`, which would claim its Notes are missing rather
  than merely unembedded.
- Trees, statistics, and graphs remain grouped by Vault; graph edges never
  cross a Vault boundary.
- A narrowed tree read never blurs "no such folder" into "empty folder", and a
  folder the depth limit held back says so rather than reading as a leaf.

**Validation:** `cargo test vault_read`, focused cache snapshot tests, and the
full backend checks.

### Vault-qualified mutation core

**Kind:** product capability/domain core; safety-critical.

**Owned paths:** `src/vault_mutation.rs`, `src/vault_error.rs`.

**Public contract:** `VaultMutationCore`, `VaultMutation`, `ensure_mutable`,
`NoteWriteOutcome`, and the transport-neutral `VaultOperationError`. ADR-19
makes this the only seam a write adapter crosses, so the core owns everything
the HTTP and MCP write adapters used to repeat around a `vault/write`
primitive: resolving the Vault ID to a control block and refusing a missing,
disabled, or runtime-less Vault; the mutation capability check; the per-Vault
mutation lock; building the authoritative index off the async runtime;
resolving the slug to an entry; refusing a write to a path this Vault's own
exclusion patterns would make invisible; resolving the archive prefix from the
Vault's own archive folder or the instance default; running the blocking write
off the async runtime; recording what that write did in the Vault's
`git::WriteLedger`, so the commit that eventually records it can say so
(#249); and returning `NoteWriteOutcome` or a structured
`VaultOperationError`. `VaultMutation::with_commit_summary` carries the
caller's one-line description of the change into that record; the private
`RecordedWrite` trait is what lets `run_write` build the record once for all
fifteen primitives instead of at each of them. `NoteWriteOutcome` carries the note's resulting layer,
resolved from the `LayerMap` the write's own pre-write index build already
holds rather than from a post-write rescan (#101). `VaultMutationCore` carries a one-shot form — gate, lock, write — for each of
the fifteen primitives, which is what a standalone caller wants:
`create_note`, `update_note`, `append_to_note`, `edit_note`,
`replace_section`, `update_frontmatter`, `rename_note`, `move_note`,
`move_rename_note`, `archive_note`, `delete_note`, `import_attachment`,
`move_attachment`, `rename_attachment`, and `delete_attachment`. It also
answers `write_capabilities`, which deliberately does *not* gate on mutability:
a Vault that refuses writes has to answer that question rather than fail it. A caller whose critical section spans several
operations on one Vault builds a `VaultMutation` with `VaultMutation::gated`
and takes the lock itself through its `acquire_mutation`: the MCP `batch` tool
holds one Vault's lock for a whole call, and `tokio::sync::Mutex` is not
reentrant, so an operation on a `VaultMutation` never re-takes the lock.
Reusing a control block the adapter already resolved also keeps every
operation in one batch on a single Vault generation. `VaultOperationError` is the `{code, message, vault_id?, retryable}`
envelope every surface already reported; it was the HTTP adapter's
`VaultApiError`, which remains as an alias in `handlers/vaults.rs` (with the
axum-shaped `respond`) — the spelling the sibling `/api/v1/vaults/...`
adapters use, now that #187 has moved the collection routes onto the core's
own name.

**Scope:** #184 proved the shape on `update_note` and `archive_note`; #186
brought the remaining thirteen primitives and write-capability discovery here,
and the adapters' own index-build, entry-lookup, marker- and noise-refusal,
filename-replacement, and write-error helpers disappeared with them. The free
function `write_operation_error` is public because the MCP
`list_note_attachments` read tool calls a `vault/write` function without being
a mutation and must not grow a second copy of that translation.

**Consumed dependencies:** `vault/write` primitives (unchanged),
`VaultReadCore::control_block` for the Vault gate, `VaultControlBlock`'s
authoritative index and mutation lock, `AppState::vault_archive_prefix`, and
the live settings snapshot.

**Consumers:** `handlers/vault_write.rs` (all eight routes) and
`mcp/tools/write.rs` (all fifteen write tools, standalone and inside `batch`).
Each is a wire-shaping adapter: it parses transport input, calls this core
once, and maps the typed outcome or the structured error onto a status code or
a JSON-RPC failure. The core has no route or tool ownership.

**Coordination paths:** `src/lib.rs` (module export),
`src/handlers/vaults.rs` (the `VaultApiError` alias and its axum `respond`).

**Invariants:**

- Writes stay inside `vault/write` (ADR-03); this core orchestrates, never
  implements, a mutation.
- Optimistic concurrency by expected content hash is unchanged, as is the
  `batch` hash chain.
- No trait seam formalises the core; it is a plain struct (ADR-13).
- Blocking work is offloaded here, so every surface offloads it.
- A caller holding the mutation lock is what serializes writes to one Vault;
  the core never re-takes a lock a caller already holds.
- Wire shapes stay adapter-owned: HTTP sanitizes a `write_failed` message,
  MCP reports it, MCP reports `noise_excluded_write` and `layer_marker_write`
  at the protocol level as invalid parameters while HTTP answers `400`, and
  none of those meanings lives in the core.
- Argument-shaped complaints stay adapter-owned too, because the two
  transports word them differently: an empty required field, a `new_title`
  carrying a path separator, the `replace_section` mode spelling, and the MCP
  base64 envelope are all parsed before the core is called.

**Validation:** `cargo test vault_mutation`, the adapter mapping tests
(`cargo test handlers`, `cargo test mcp`, `cargo test server`), and the full
backend checks.

### Vault collection management

**Kind:** product capability/domain core.

**Owned paths:** `src/vault_management.rs`.

**Public contract:** `VaultCollectionManagement`, the collection wire types
(`VaultSummary`, `VaultDiscoveryResponse`, `VaultMutationResponse`,
`VaultScheduleResponse`, `RegistryRecoveryInfo`,
`LegacyMigrationRecoveryInfo`), the two definition inputs
(`CreateVaultRequest`, `EditVaultRequest`, with `HttpsCredentialsInput` and
the three-state `HttpsCredentialsPatch`), and `parse_vault_id`. This is the
one place a Vault definition changes, so it owns the sequence every change
runs — commit to the registry, reconcile the live runtime through its
foreground-mutation safe boundary, then answer from a single collection
snapshot so the reported `collection_revision` and the returned Vault's status
can never disagree — plus `list` (with its authenticated and demo
projections), `create`, `edit`, `set_enabled`, `disconnect`, the manual
`sync`/`retry`/`refresh` controls, and the confirmed `start_with_no_vaults`
recovery. Since #267 `sync`/`retry` choose the operation from what the Vault
actually has: a remote sync through `ManagedGitScheduler` for a Vault with a
remote, and a `VaultWorkKind::Commit` request (plus a clear of that Vault's
`git::CommitCooldown`, because an operator asking explicitly is exactly the
case suppression must not swallow) for one that keeps history but has no
remote. `capability_unavailable` narrowed with it: it now names only a Vault
with no Git at all, not every Vault with no remote.

`VaultSummary` carries two optional RFC 3339 UTC timestamps
alongside the status fields — `last_checked_at` and `next_attempt_at`, read
from `git::ManagedGitScheduler::polling_clock` — so a caller can tell a Vault
that polled and found nothing from one that is not polling at all, which the
status fields alone cannot express. `last_checked_at` reports when the last
interval-arming turn *finished*, whether it succeeded or failed: a failed
check is still a check, and `git`/`git_error` already say which it was, so
naming it after a sync would report one for a Vault that has only ever failed
to authenticate. Both are absent for a source with no remote to poll and in
the demo projection, which withholds operator deployment detail;
`last_checked_at` is additionally absent until a turn completes, while
`next_attempt_at` is always present for a tracked Vault, because one that has
never completed a turn is due immediately rather than unscheduled. Failures leave as the transport-neutral `VaultOperationError`
(ADR-19). Creating a Vault on a `Local` source whose directory holds no
Markdown seeds the starter Vault (`vault::seed_new_vault`) between the
registry commit and reconciliation, so both surfaces seed identically and the
welcome notes are in that Vault's first index rather than arriving as a later
watcher event; emptiness is decided with the Vault's own exclude matcher, a
Git-backed source is never seeded, and nothing but creation seeds. An edit
whose `https_credentials` was `Replace` additionally requests an immediate Git
turn and notifies a definition change, because `VaultDefinition` equality
cannot observe a credential value change (#97's and #98's reopening
findings).

Discovery reports two independent recovery signals. `recovery` means the
persisted registry file itself is unreadable; `legacy_migration_recovery`
(`{code: "legacy_migration_required", message}`) means the registry loaded fine
(empty, revision 0) but automatic legacy import could not prove the deployment
and is still pending (#150), in which case no Vaults are listed at all.
`start_with_no_vaults` is the confirmed action for the second: it requires a
pending failed import and an explicit `confirm`, commits an ordinary empty
revision-1 registry (refusing `registry_revision_conflict` if the registry
already holds real state), reconciles like every other commit here, and clears
the flag. Because clearing it must work without a restart, `AppState` holds it
as `Arc<StdRwLock<Option<LegacyMigrationRecovery>>>` rather than a plain
`Option` fixed at construction.

**Scope:** #187 moved this out of `handlers/vaults.rs`, where the seven MCP
management tools reached it by calling handler functions with hand-built axum
extractors and decoding the HTTP response body. No wire shape changed.

**Consumed dependencies:** `VaultRegistryStore::{load, add, edit, enable,
disable, disconnect}`, `VaultCollectionRuntime::{snapshot,
reconcile_and_reconstruct_and_wait_for_mutation_boundary, runtime,
notify_definition_changed, subscribe_revisions}`,
`ManagedGitScheduler::{sync_now, retry_now, polling_clock}`,
`vault_runtime_state::format_timestamp`, `VaultWorkCoordinator::request`,
`vault_migration::start_with_no_vaults`, `vault::seed_new_vault`, and
`AppState`'s composed handles including `demo_mode` and the pending
`legacy_migration_recovery` flag.

**Consumers:** `handlers/vaults.rs` (every `/api/v1/vaults` route) and
`mcp/tools/read.rs` (`list_vaults`, `create_vault`, `edit_vault`,
`enable_vault`, `disable_vault`, `disconnect_vault`, `sync_vault`,
`retry_vault`, `refresh_vault`). `POST /api/v1/vaults/{vault_id}/refresh` and
the `refresh_vault` MCP tool (#228) are the same single call onto `refresh`,
the way sync and retry pair across the two surfaces. Each is a wire-shaping
adapter: it parses transport input, calls this core once, and maps the typed
response or the structured error onto a status code or a structured tool
error. No MCP tool calls a handler function or decodes an HTTP response for
Vault management. `mcp/results.rs` aliases the collection wire types as its
management tool result types, so the advertised `outputSchema` is generated
from the same structures the core returns.

**Coordination paths:** `src/lib.rs` (module export).

**Invariants:**

- HTTPS credentials never appear in any projection, error, or status;
  `credential_configured` is the only signal (#133).
- Demo mode lists only enabled Vaults and withholds `source`, exclusion
  patterns, archive folder, commit identity, and runtime error details (#109),
  and reports per-Vault `capabilities` as what an unauthenticated visitor may
  do rather than as derived: `mutate`, `pull`, `push`, `retry`, `commit`, and
  `sync` are false, because the demo guard refuses every route behind them
  (#243, extended by #267's two new capability flags). `browse` and
  `search` stay derived, and the four status fields, `local_content` included,
  keep describing the Vault.
- An instance-side failure is logged with its detail and reported with a
  sanitized message here, so neither surface can leak a filesystem path by
  skipping the scrubbing.
- Every registry mutation reconciles within the same call, so the collection
  revision and the SSE stream never lag a commit.
- Status codes, rejection wording, the demo-mode refusal, and the SSE
  `Event`/keep-alive framing stay adapter-owned; none of those meanings lives
  in the core. The revision channel the stream publishes from is reached
  through `subscribe_revisions` here, so the adapter never reaches past a core
  into the runtime (ADR-19).
- ADR-07, ADR-09, ADR-13, ADR-19.

**Validation:** `cargo test vault_management`, the adapter mapping tests
(`cargo test vaults`, `cargo test mcp`, `cargo test server`), and the full
backend checks.

### Cache and query read model

**Kind:** infrastructure/read model.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/cache/mod.rs`
- `src/cache/chunk_ops.rs`
- `src/cache/parse.rs`
- `src/cache/populate.rs`
- `src/cache/schema.rs`
- `src/cache/queries/mod.rs`
- `src/cache/queries/graph.rs`
- `src/cache/queries/metadata.rs`
- `src/cache/queries/search.rs`
- `src/cache/vault_snapshots.rs`

**Public contract:** `SqliteCache`, `ReadConn`, `BuildOptions`, `SemanticHit`,
and the methods implemented on `SqliteCache`. The read queries are the
Vault-qualified snapshot lookups, the evaluation binaries' `semantic_search`
and `fts_search_notes`, `read_note_by_slug`, and the link/wikilink queries;
the scope-less stats, explorer-tree, recently-modified, read-by-path,
demoted-layer, note-summary, health-check, graph, and layered/filtered
search variants are retired. The crate-private
`vault_snapshots` seam owns Vault-ID-qualified candidate publication,
stale/participation state, attempt ordering, and Vault-local disposal in the
shared cache. Publication carries the caller's freshness verdict rather than
assuming `Fresh`, and `MutationGuardHandoff` is how an Index turn hands its
Vault read lock through a build: released at the read/embed boundary, retaken
to answer that verdict under one acquisition with the publication it labels
(issue #223). `parse` is currently public and
also supplies parsing/hash behavior to vault indexing, and its
`frontmatter_span`/`parse_frontmatter_metadata` parsing to the shared write
layer's frontmatter merge. It is also the single home of the Markdown
code-region scanner: the crate-private `for_non_code_line`, which walks the
lines Markdown renders as prose, and `parse_fence_marker`, which recognizes a
fence delimiter. The Vault link reader and the asset-reference rewriter consume
`for_non_code_line`; the backlink, section, and asset-reference rewriters
consume `parse_fence_marker` for their own line-rebuilding loops, which must
preserve line endings and so cannot use the visiting form. It lives here
because tag extraction, link extraction, and rewriting have to agree on what
counts as code: an indexer that reads a hashtag inside a fenced block as a tag
while a rewrite refuses to touch it makes a Vault-wide tag rename look
half-applied (#248, unblocking #242). The copies merged here were behaviorally
identical, so consolidating them changed nothing; the point is that the next
correction lands in one place instead of three. The crate-private
`is_recognized_legacy_cache` inspection seam owns the supported legacy schema
fingerprint and opens existing files read-only for the one-time migration.
`ReadSnapshot` is the crate-private pinned-read seam used where participant
metadata and cache queries must observe one published generation.

**Consumed dependencies:** Vault IDs and index/types, chunking, embeddings, SQLite,
FTS5, and sqlite-vec.

**Consumers:** application state/reindexing, runtime composition's per-Vault
Index dispatch, Vault-qualified read projections, the Vault-qualified search
core, handlers, MCP reads, evaluation tooling, diagnostics, and the one-time
legacy single-Vault migration's read-only evidence check.

**Coordination paths:** `src/app_state.rs`, `src/vault_runtime.rs`,
`src/vault_read.rs`, `src/search/**`, `src/vault/index.rs`, `src/chunk/**`,
and embedder identity/dimensions.

**Invariants:**

- SQLite is rebuildable and never authoritative (ADR-01).
- Keep embedded SQLite, FTS5, sqlite-vec, WAL, one writer, and pooled
  query-only reads (ADR-06).
- The reader pool is a ceiling on live SQLite handles, not a load-shedding
  policy. A caller at `MAX_READ_CONNECTIONS` waits up to `READ_LEASE_WAIT` for
  a slot and only then reports the pool as exhausted, so no read holds a slot
  across slow work that does not touch the database. Embedding in particular
  runs before the search core takes its snapshot: holding a slot across the
  embedder's inference lock let four concurrent searches starve every other
  read. Waiters are woken one at a time and not in arrival order.
- Schema or embedder identity mismatch rebuilds rather than mixing data.
- A refresh commits a coherent new read snapshot.
- Shared semantic vectors have one embedder identity and dimension; a mismatch
  wipes the disposable cache before any partial rebuild can participate.
  The cache-wide model epoch covers snapshot and legacy builders, and stamps
  the shared identity atomically with snapshot participation.
- Every shared snapshot row and relationship is Vault-ID-qualified; failed
  replacement retains the prior snapshot as stale, disabling removes only
  participation, and disconnect deletes only that Vault's disposable rows.
- A population pass drops every cached note row that will not still hold its
  slug when the pass ends - the notes that left the Vault and the notes whose
  slug moved to another path - before it writes any row. A slug is unique and
  migrates between paths whenever a note is added, moved, or renamed beside a
  same-named sibling, so releasing it late fails the whole turn (issue #226).

**Validation:** `cargo test cache` and full backend checks. Schema/population
changes require search and application-state tests too.

### Chunking

**Kind:** infrastructure/indexing policy.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/chunk/mod.rs`
- `src/chunk/chunker.rs`
- `src/chunk/normalize.rs`

**Public contract:** `Chunk`, `ChunkOptions`, `NoteChunking`, `chunk_note`, and
normalization behavior re-exported by `src/chunk/mod.rs`.

**Consumed dependencies:** Markdown text and tokenizer-aware splitting.

**Consumers:** cache population and evaluation/index microbench tooling.

**Coordination paths:** cache population, embedder token limits, and evaluation
baselines.

**Invariants:** chunk boundaries and contextual text changes alter every
embedding and therefore require deliberate evaluation, not only unit tests.

**Validation:** `cargo test chunk`, cache population tests, and relevant eval
commands when retrieval behavior may change.

### Runtime Search

**Kind:** product capability/domain service.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/search/mod.rs`
- `src/search/layer_selection.rs`
- `src/search/vault_scoped.rs`

**Public contract:** the shared search vocabulary `SearchMode`,
`LayerSelection`, `LayerInfo`, `OutboundLink`, and the two crate-internal tag
primitives `normalize_tag_path` and `tag_matches` (#274). Those two say what a
tag is and what "nested under it" means, which the Vault-read core's metadata
query needs to answer a tag condition the way the indexer stored the tag.
`vault_scoped::tag_results` keeps its own inline copy of the same predicate,
because rewriting it would touch the retrieval path and cost an eval run
(ADR-15) for no behaviour change; the two are held in step by review rather
than by construction, so an edit to either is an edit to both. The Vault-qualified
shared-core contract is `VaultSearchCore`, `VaultSearchRequest`,
`VaultSearchResponse`, and `VaultSearchResult`; it uses the explicit
`VaultScope` and common projection/participant envelope from the Vault-read
core without owning any HTTP, MCP, or frontend adapter. `VaultSearchCore` is
the only search entry point: the scope-less single-Vault `run`, its retrieve
and assemble helpers, and its request/result/response types are retired.

**Consumed dependencies:** `SqliteCache`, its published Vault snapshot/cache
query seam, `Embedder`, the Vault collection runtime, the explicit Vault-read
scope/envelope, and vault metadata/types.

**Consumers:** `handlers/vault_collection_reads.rs` (the HTTP consumer of
`VaultSearchCore::search`), MCP search tools, offline evaluation runners,
`vault_read/query.rs` (the two tag primitives only, never the retrieval path),
and future Vault-scoped MCP adapters.

**Coordination paths:** `src/handlers/vault_collection_reads.rs`,
`src/mcp/tools/read.rs`, cache query methods, and frontend Search contracts.

**Invariants:**

- Runtime search defaults to pure semantic retrieval; hybrid and reranking stay
  offline (ADR-05).
- Layer selection must never widen the eligible result set.
- There is one retrieval path per mode. #210 removed the unreachable note
  metadata filters, the property projection, and the second semantic path they
  selected; a search result's metadata still serializes its `properties` as an
  empty object. Property search is a new feature carrying its own eval
  evidence, never a restoration of that code.
- Vault-qualified search globally ranks every usable Vault snapshot, caps by
  `(Vault ID, slug)`, and never deduplicates equal content or note names across
  Vaults. Staleness is participant status, not a relevance penalty.
- Semantic per-note-cap selection progressively enlarges its KNN candidate
  window only as needed, stopping at candidate exhaustion or the explicit
  200-candidate ceiling. If that bounded window is dominated by capped notes,
  it returns the best available cap-compliant partial set without changing
  semantic ranking.
- Participant metadata, note projections, and KNN/FTS hits for one search
  response come from one pinned SQLite generation.
- A semantic query is embedded before that generation is pinned, never while
  holding it. Inference is serialized behind the embedder's own lock, so a
  reader slot held across it is a slot no other request can use. The order
  costs an embedding on a query whose Vaults turn out not to participate, and
  reports an unhealthy embedder ahead of a bad layer name or an unavailable
  single Vault, both of which need the pinned generation to detect.
- A structure-only frontend Search pilot must not modify these paths.

**Validation:** `cargo test search`, focused Vault-scoped and cache query tests,
and evaluation-only checks when retrieval semantics change.

### Embeddings and model implementations

**Kind:** infrastructure/external-model seam.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/embed/mod.rs`
- `src/embed/candle_embedder.rs`
- `src/embed/context.rs`
- `src/embed/embedder.rs`
- `src/embed/fastembed_embedder.rs`
- `src/embed/hub.rs`
- `src/embed/matryoshka.rs`

**Public contract:** `Embedder`, `RuntimeEmbedder`, concrete embedders,
`MatryoshkaEmbedder`, `StubEmbedder`, and contextual-document formatting. The
ONNX embedders are exported unconditionally; `NomicV2Embedder` and
`Qwen3Embedder` are exported only under the `eval` feature, so a default build
of the crate does not carry them.

**Consumed dependencies:** local model runtimes, tokenizers, and Hugging Face
model files; under the `eval` feature also `candle-core` and FastEmbed's
`qwen3` / `nomic-v2-moe` features.

**Consumers:** cache building, runtime Search, startup/model setup, auxiliary
evaluation binaries, and tests.

**Coordination paths:** `src/model_setup.rs`, cache schema/identity handling,
chunking, Docker model prefetch, `Cargo.toml`'s `eval` feature, and evaluation
documentation.

**Invariants:** local inference only (ADR-04); embedder identity must encode
behavior affecting stored vectors; the `Embedder` trait remains the deliberate
test seam rather than proliferating model abstractions (ADR-13); the production
ONNX embedders are unconditional, while `src/embed/candle_embedder.rs` and the
candle inference stack it needs stay behind the non-default `eval` feature and
must never become reachable from a default build.

**Validation:** `cargo test embed`; feature-gated or model-loading tests when
applicable; cache identity/rebuild tests for identity changes; `cargo clippy
--all-targets --all-features` so the `eval`-gated embedders still compile.

### Reranking

**Kind:** offline evaluation infrastructure.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/rerank/mod.rs`
- `src/rerank/fastembed_reranker.rs`
- `src/rerank/reranker.rs`

**Public contract:** `Reranker`, `FastembedReranker`, `StubReranker`, and
`RerankedHit`.

**Consumers:** evaluation tooling only.

**Coordination paths:** `src/eval/**` and `src/bin/eval.rs`.

**Invariant:** reranking must not enter the runtime search path without
superseding ADR-05.

**Validation:** `cargo test rerank` and relevant eval runner tests.

### Git synchronization

**Kind:** infrastructure/background capability.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/git/mod.rs`
- `src/git/commit_cooldown.rs`
- `src/git/config.rs`
- `src/git/managed_checkout.rs`
- `src/git/managed_sync.rs`
- `src/git/managed_task.rs`
- `src/git/message.rs`
- `src/git/sync.rs`

**Public contract:** `GitMode` (`off`/`local`, carried only by the legacy
first-boot import — the instance-wide runtime lane is gone, #185), `GitConfig`,
write-record/message types (`WriteRecord`, `WriteLedger`,
`build_commit_message`), commit outcomes and errors (including
`GitError::ManualRecovery` for repository operations that cannot be proven
Hatchdoor-owned), and the local repository operations `validate_repo`,
`validate_local_repo`, `init_local_repo`, `commit_local`,
`has_uncommitted_changes`, and `run_local_history_git_turn`. Since #249
`run_local_history_git_turn` takes the Vault's `&WriteLedger` and names its
commit from the batch waiting there, restoring that batch when the turn finds
nothing to commit. Only the last
three are on a live path; `validate_repo`, `init_local_repo`, and
`has_uncommitted_changes` lost their production callers with the settings
lifecycle and the boot-time legacy validation in #185 and are retained
deliberately by that ticket's explicit keep list, against #82's removal of the
legacy import. The crate-private
`parse_mode` and `non_empty_setting` helpers keep startup and one-time
migration interpretation identical. `resolve_commit_identity` (issue #130)
resolves one Vault's own configured `VaultCommitIdentity`
(`vault_registry.rs`) if set, else the instance-wide
`HATCHDOOR_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`HATCHDOOR_GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` defaults; the Vault
work executor's `dispatch_git_turn` calls it once per turn, before
planning any of the branches below, so every commit this boundary makes
for a Vault — managed-Git, existing-Git remote-sync, or existing-Git
Local-history — honors that Vault's own identity. `commit_local` commits without network
access and discovers an enclosing existing checkout while staging only the
configured Vault subtree. Remote fetch/integrate/push, unpushed accounting,
and interrupted-merge marker recovery are gone with the instance-wide task
(#185); every remote graph operation this boundary still performs lives in
`managed_sync.rs`, which owns its own conflict and containment rules.
`classify_local_history_error` still reports an encountered `ManualRecovery`
as the non-retryable
`existing_git_local_history_manual_recovery_required`, defensively rather
than because a local-history turn can produce one. This boundary has no wire
surface and no instance-wide lifecycle: `GET /api/git-status` was retired in
#183 along with the Settings console it fed, and the settings handler's
preflight → drain → replacement protocol went with the task itself in #185.
`init_local_repo` takes the vault's configured
cache-database and settings-file paths and derives `.gitignore` entries from
them (only when those paths live inside the vault), appending to an existing
`.gitignore` rather than skipping it.

`ManagedCheckoutLease`, `ManagedCheckoutRequest`, `ManagedHttpsCredentials`,
and `acquire_or_reuse` form the shared-core managed-HTTPS acquisition boundary.
It holds a per-Vault process ownership lease, clones only into an
application-owned temporary sibling, validates origin, branch, repository
shape, and canonical Vault containment before atomic installation, and writes
an application-owned receipt that retains a once-resolved default branch.
Reuse accepts only a receipt-backed matching checkout; unknown, interrupted,
damaged, mismatched, credential-bearing, or out-of-containment destinations
remain untouched and are rejected. This boundary neither fetches nor resets,
checks out, polls, pushes, or attempts automatic reacquisition/recovery.
`reuse_existing_checkout` is `acquire_or_reuse` with the acquisition half
removed and `Ok(None)` in its place (#267): a commit turn must open no network
connection, and cloning is one, so it reuses the checkout a Vault already has
and reports "nothing here yet" rather than creating one.

`ManagedSyncConfig`, `ManagedSyncMode`, `ManagedSyncOutcome`,
`ManagedSyncError`, and `synchronize_managed_checkout` form the next shared-core
managed-checkout graph boundary. A caller that holds the checkout lease and
serializes Vault writes supplies the already validated repository and contained
Vault root, plus that Vault's `&WriteLedger`: a Two-way commit takes the
pending batch at the moment it is certain to commit and builds its message
from it (#249), restoring the batch if the commit itself fails, while
Pull-only never commits and leaves the ledger alone. Pull-only refuses and preserves any local work or local-only
history, then only fast-forwards a clean checkout. Two-way commits Vault-subtree
work before every tree-changing graph operation, refuses unrelated repository
work, fast-forwards remote-only advancement, creates a merge commit for clean
divergence, aborts a verified clean conflict back to the pre-merge local commit,
and never pushes after conflict. It uses safe checkout transitions and rejects
outside-Vault dirt rather than overwriting it; the narrowly scoped conflict
abort is the only hard reset. A non-fast-forward push retries only through one
bounded fetch-integrate-push graph replay before returning a redacted push-race
error. `commit_managed_checkout` is the Two-way commit without the graph
(#267): the same `prepare_two_way_worktree` step, and then it stops, with no
fetch, merge or push. It validates through `open_commit_repository`, which
proves the repository shape and Vault containment and nothing else;
`open_validated_repository` is that plus the checked-out branch and the
uniquely selected remote, which only an operation that talks to that remote
needs. Pull-only is refused outright, because such a Vault refuses writes and
must leave a folder its operator dirtied alone.

The uniquely selected managed remote and its push URL must remain the
configured credential-free HTTPS repository identity; unrelated remotes in an
operator-owned `ExistingGit` checkout are outside this boundary and untouched.
Public HTTPS makes no credential callback; supplied credentials are callback
input only and remain redacted. This boundary does not acquire, delete,
schedule, poll, persist status, or repair checkouts.

`WriteRecord`, `WriteLedger`, and `build_commit_message` are what makes a
commit say what happened. One Git turn coalesces every Vault write since the
last one, so the record of each write waits in the Vault's ledger in between:
the mutation core appends one `WriteRecord` per successful write, and the two
functions that actually commit — `commit_vault_drift` (Two-way) and
`commit_local` through `run_local_history_git_turn` (Local history) — take the
whole batch and name the commit from it. Title: the first three operations and
the unique file count. Body: one `- ` line per caller-supplied summary. A
commit whose batch is empty, which is what drift from outside Hatchdoor
produces, keeps the generic `hatchdoor: vault update`. The ledger is bounded
(`WriteLedger::CAPACITY`) because a `Local` Vault has no Git turn to take it.

`ManagedGitTurnConfig`, `ManagedGitOutcome`, `run_managed_git_turn`,
`ManagedGitScheduler`, `GitPollingClock`, `spawn_scheduler_tick`,
`DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL`, and `DEFAULT_TICK_INTERVAL` form the per-Vault managed-Git scheduling boundary —
the "later consumer" the two paragraphs above anticipated. `run_managed_git_turn`
is the concrete `acquire_or_reuse`-then-`synchronize_managed_checkout` operation
`VaultWorkKind::Git` executes; it classifies every `ManagedCheckoutError`/
`ManagedSyncError` into a redacted `VaultWorkError{code, message, retryable}`,
distinguishing authentication failures (`ManagedCheckoutError::AuthenticationFailed`,
`ManagedSyncError::Authentication`, detected via `git2::ErrorCode::Auth`) from
other remote failures. It takes a `&ManagedCheckoutLease` rather than acquiring
its own (issue #95): the process-lifetime ownership boundary the checkout
lease documents is held by the caller across every turn for a Vault, not
reacquired and dropped within each one. `ManagedGitScheduler` is one
process-wide instance — mirroring the coordinator's single-worker design, it
adds no per-Vault execution lane — that decides *when* to request a Vault's
next Git turn: that Vault's own configured `poll_interval_secs` (issue #97's
reopening finding 2 — previously one `poll_interval` shared by the whole
scheduler; `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL`, 24h, is now only the fallback default a
Vault's registry record defaults to, mirrored by
`vault_registry::DEFAULT_MANAGED_GIT_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS`) after a success or
any non-retryable failure (including authentication, which never backs off —
it waits for a configuration change, a manual `sync_now`/`retry_now`, a
restart, or the normal schedule), or bounded exponential backoff after a
retryable (transient) failure. `activate(vault_id, poll_interval)` registers a
newly tracked Vault one poll interval after its last remembered
interval-arming turn — immediately when nothing is remembered, or when that
deadline has already passed. For an already-tracked Vault it updates the
stored interval in place and, when the new interval brings that same
deadline forward, re-arms the pending attempt to it: an operator shortens an
interval *for* the next check, so a Vault sitting on a long armed deadline
must not serve the whole of it out before the edit is visible. Only forward
— a lengthened interval leaves the nearer deadline where it is — and never
over a live backoff: a transient failure's backoff is not on the poll
interval at all, so re-deriving it from the last interval-arming turn would
discard the throttle on a remote that is currently failing. A held checkout
lease is untouched either way; it is not a condition on the re-arm. The
interval is clamped to `MAX_POLL_INTERVAL` on the way in, so no deadline this
module arms can overflow — `poll_interval_secs` has a registry minimum but no
maximum, and `record_outcome` arms under the `entries` lock, where a panic
would poison the scheduler for every Vault in the process.
`sync_now`/`retry_now` take the same `poll_interval`
so a manual control before a Vault's first turn still registers it correctly.
`tick()` skips a Vault whose Git turn is already active or already has a
pending rerun queued (via `VaultWorkCoordinator::has_work`) rather than
calling `request` unconditionally (issue #97's reopening finding 1): a Git
turn can outlast `DEFAULT_TICK_INTERVAL`, and requesting for an
already-active Vault would otherwise pre-queue a zero-delay rerun that fires
the instant that turn completes, before its outcome's backoff is armed —
defeating backoff on every retryable failure. This skip is scoped to
`tick()`'s own automatic due-check; `sync_now`/`retry_now` still coalesce a
manual request into the turn's one guaranteed rerun exactly as before.
`spawn_scheduler_tick` drives it on
`DEFAULT_TICK_INTERVAL`. `ManagedGitScheduler` also holds each active Vault's
`ManagedCheckoutLease` for that Vault's entire activation lifetime in this
process, through its crate-private `take_or_acquire_checkout_lease`/
`keep_checkout_lease` pair: the former returns an already-held lease or
acquires a fresh one, the latter hands a lease back after a turn so it stays
held (and its OS-level lock stays exclusive to this process) across turns
instead of being released at the end of each one. `deactivate` drops any held
lease, releasing the lock immediately for retirement, disable, disconnect, or
restart-reuse by a later process.

`with_state_store` is the production constructor: it gives the scheduler a
`vault_runtime_state::VaultRuntimeStateStore`, which is what makes a poll
interval survive a restart. Each Vault's record is read once at `activate`
time and refreshed by `record_outcome` after every interval-arming outcome —
a success or a non-retryable failure, never a transient failure, whose
backoff stays process-local because a restart cannot verify the condition it
was throttling and should retry at once. What is remembered is the *last
turn*, never a computed deadline, so an interval edited while Hatchdoor is
down takes effect on the next start rather than serving out the interval that
was in force when the record was written. The wall clock is consulted only to
derive that first deadline; the countdown itself is held as an `Instant`, so a
host clock moving mid-process cannot disturb it, and a stored stamp in the
future is treated as unknown rather than delaying a Vault by the skew. A
store failure is logged and dropped — the turn already happened, and
forgetting it costs one extra turn after the next restart.
`forget_persisted_state` prunes a Vault that has left the collection, called
by the collection lifecycle for a disconnect (never for a disable, which
keeps its schedule). `polling_clock(vault_id)` returns the
`GitPollingClock { last_checked_at, next_attempt_at }` a status read
renders, and `remembered_turn(vault_id)` returns the whole remembered record;
both come from memory, so listing the collection never touches the file.
The collection lifecycle uses `remembered_turn` at activation to republish
the Git status the previous process reached — guarded on the `Pending` a
fresh process publishes, so an in-process edit keeps the live status
`reconcile` preserved through `prior_git`. Without it a restart would report
nothing wrong about a failing Vault until its next scheduled turn, which is a
whole poll interval now that a restart no longer forces one.
`without_durable_state` is the store-less constructor — every Vault due
immediately, every schedule lost with the process — named so that a call site
cannot opt out of remembering without saying so; it exists for tests and for
composition roots with nowhere durable to write.

`DEFAULT_TICK_INTERVAL` is a *sampling* interval, not a schedule: a deadline
can only be observed at its resolution, so a compile-time assertion holds it
to at most half of `BACKOFF_BASE`. At one sample per backoff base every
"30 second" retry would land at 60, collapsing `BACKOFF_BASE` into
`BACKOFF_MAX`; the assertion turns lowering either constant without the other
into a build failure rather than a silently degraded retry.

`run_local_history_git_turn` is an `ExistingGit` + `VaultGitMode::LocalHistory`
Vault's counterpart to `run_managed_git_turn`: given the Vault's already-resolved
path and commit identity, it builds its own placeholder `GitMode::Local`
`GitConfig` and calls `validate_local_repo` then `commit_local`, committing
only the contained Vault subtree of whatever enclosing checkout the Vault sits
in and never contacting a remote. It classifies every `GitError` into a
redacted `VaultWorkError`, mirroring the legacy single-Vault task's transient
split (`Remote`/`Other` retry; validation, conflict, and dirty-tree do not).
Unlike managed-Git Vaults, an `ExistingGit` Local-history Vault is never
registered with `ManagedGitScheduler`. Before #267 that left it with exactly
one turn per process, the `Pending`-triggered one at activation, so every
note written afterwards sat uncommitted until a restart. It now receives a
`VaultWorkKind::Commit` turn from the watcher on every change (and that
activation turn is a `Commit` too), which is the whole of its Git behaviour;
it still has no remote and still never polls one.

`run_managed_git_commit_turn` and `run_existing_git_commit_turn` are the
commit-only counterparts of the two remote-sync turns above, and what
`VaultWorkKind::Commit` executes (#267). Both refuse any mode but `TwoWay`
with the non-retryable `vault_commit_mode_does_not_commit`; Local history's
commit turn is `run_local_history_git_turn`, unchanged. The managed one takes
the same `&ManagedCheckoutLease` a sync turn takes but reaches the checkout
through `reuse_existing_checkout`, so a Vault whose first clone has not landed
reports `UpToDate` instead of cloning; it carries no credentials, because
there is nothing to authenticate against. The existing-checkout one takes
neither a `repository_url` nor a `branch` and leaves both blank in its
`ManagedSyncConfig`, because `commit_managed_checkout` reads neither. That is
what lets an `ExistingGit` Vault with no configured branch commit without
resolving one. Neither reaches `ManagedGitScheduler`: a commit is not a check
of the remote and must not move the schedule that governs one.

`CommitCooldown`, `DEFAULT_COMMIT_COOLDOWN` (5 minutes),
`COMMIT_COOLDOWN_TICK_INTERVAL`, and `spawn_commit_cooldown_tick`
(`commit_cooldown.rs`) are what stops a standing commit failure becoming one
failed turn per save. Every way a commit can fail is non-retryable and needs a
human, so a failed commit turn `arm`s the Vault's window and the
watcher-forwarding path stops being `admit`ted for its duration; a successful
commit or a manual one `clear`s it. Changes arriving while suppressed are not
dropped. They coalesce into one deferred request the tick issues once the
window elapses, which is what lets a Vault resume committing on its own after
the operator fixes the cause. State is process-local and disposable: nothing
about a suppression window is worth surviving a restart.

`source_commits` and `source_syncs_remote` (`mod.rs`) answer "does this Vault
make local commits" and "does it have a remote to sync with" from a
`VaultSource` alone. Deliberately separate from
`VaultSource::managed_git_poll_interval`, whose meaning ("does this Vault poll
a remote") is unchanged: the watcher uses the first to decide whether a change
is worth a commit turn, `vault_management` uses it to decide which manual
operation to admit, and `collection_capabilities` publishes both as the
`commit`/`sync` Vault capabilities the settings Git console labels its action
from.

`run_existing_git_remote_turn` is an `ExistingGit` + `VaultGitMode::PullOnly`/
`TwoWay` Vault's counterpart to `run_managed_git_turn` (issue #96's reopening
defect 1): it builds a `ManagedSyncConfig` directly from the Vault's
already-existing `repository_path`/resolved Vault path and calls
`synchronize_managed_checkout` against it — no `ManagedCheckoutLease`
acquisition: that machinery exists specifically for Hatchdoor-managed clones
into Hatchdoor-owned state directories tracked via a receipt file, and an
`ExistingGit` checkout is the operator's own pre-existing directory with
nothing to clone or track, the same reasoning that already applied to
`run_local_history_git_turn`. When the registry's `branch` is unconfigured
(`ExistingGit`, unlike `ManagedGit`, has no receipt-file-persisted resolved
branch and the registry does not require one for `PullOnly`/`TwoWay`), it
falls back to whatever branch is currently checked out at `repository_path`,
extending `validate_local_repo`'s Local-history "follows whatever branch the
operator has checked out" policy to the remote-sync target. It classifies
every `ManagedSyncError` through the same `classify_sync_error` table
`run_managed_git_turn` uses, now also carrying `DirtyWorkingCopy`/`Conflict`'s
affected paths and `LocalCommits`' count outward as structured
`VaultWorkErrorDetail` (issue #132), bounded and published as
`vault_runtime::VaultRuntimeErrorDetail` on `VaultRuntimeError`. Unlike
Local-history, an `ExistingGit` Vault in `PullOnly`/`TwoWay` mode *is*
registered with `ManagedGitScheduler` (issue #132) — it has a remote to poll
on a schedule, unlike Local-history's commit-only-on-local-drift turn.
For both managed and existing checkouts, `ManagedSyncConfig.repository_url` is
the remote identity: synchronization requires exactly one fetch remote whose
URL equals it, and uses that remote name for fetch, tracking refs, merge labels,
and push. Only that selected remote and its optional push URL are constrained to
the same credential-free HTTPS identity; unrelated operator-owned remotes in an
`ExistingGit` checkout are ignored and never contacted.

**Consumed dependencies:** local Git repository through `git2`, the live
configuration snapshot for startup parsing, and the registry's shared
credential-free HTTPS URL validator, `VaultId` identity, and the crate-private
`https_credentials` accessor (managed-Git turns only; never exposed further).

**Consumers:** server startup, write adapters, status handlers/tools,
`AppState`, and the one-time legacy single-Vault migration parser.
`ManagedGitScheduler`/`run_managed_git_turn` are consumed by the Vault work
executor (`src/vault_executor.rs::dispatch_git_turn`) and by runtime
composition (`reconcile_and_reconstruct`, which activates/deactivates a
managed-Git Vault's schedule alongside its coordinator admission). `dispatch_git_turn_with`
obtains the Vault's checkout lease via
`ManagedGitScheduler::take_or_acquire_checkout_lease` before `spawn_blocking`,
passes it into the injected turn (`run_managed_git_turn` in production), and
hands it back with `keep_checkout_lease` once the turn completes, so the
lease survives across turns without being borrowed across the
`spawn_blocking` boundary — and by
`src/server.rs`, which
owns the one global consumer loop driving `VaultWorkWorker::run_next` — the
worker/scheduler-tick construction and dispatch this module map previously
noted as missing. `run_local_history_git_turn` is likewise consumed by `plan_git_turn`'s
`ExistingGit` + `VaultGitMode::LocalHistory` arm, off the async runtime via
`spawn_blocking`, publishing through the same
`publish_managed_git_turn_outcome` a managed-Git turn uses; that Vault is
never registered with `ManagedGitScheduler`, so this arm is its whole
Git-turn responsibility. `run_existing_git_remote_turn` is consumed the same
way by `plan_git_turn`'s `ExistingGit` + `VaultGitMode::PullOnly`/`TwoWay` arm
(issue #96's reopening defect 1): no checkout lease, but the same
`VaultControlBlock::acquire_mutation` hold across `spawn_blocking` that the
`ManagedGit` arm also takes (defect 2), and publication through the same
`publish_managed_git_turn_outcome`.
`VaultWorkKind::Commit` is consumed by the Vault work executor's
`dispatch_commit_turn`/`plan_commit_turn`, which resolve the Vault's source
and mode to one of the three commit operations, run it through the same
lease/mutation-lock/`spawn_blocking` shell (`run_planned_turn`) a Git turn
uses, and publish through `finish_commit_turn`, which unlike
`finish_git_turn` feeds no scheduler and queues no Index turn, because the
watcher change that asked for the commit already asked for the reindex. It is
requested by `src/server.rs`'s watcher forwarding (commit first, index second,
so a commit never waits out a multi-minute rebuild), by
`reconcile_and_reconstruct`'s activation gate for a Git-capable source the
scheduler does not track, by `vault_management`'s manual sync/retry on a Vault
with no remote, and by `spawn_commit_cooldown_tick`.
`VaultWorkKind::Index` is consumed by the Vault work executor's
`dispatch_vault_index_turn`, which publishes only that Vault's disposable
snapshot and reports its per-Vault search outcome; `Repair` remains an explicit
non-retryable "not yet implemented" `VaultWorkError` so a Vault's shared FIFO
position is not blocked ahead of its Git turn.

**Coordination paths:** `src/app_state.rs`, `src/server.rs`,
`src/vault_executor.rs`, `src/vault_runtime.rs`, `src/vault_registry.rs` (crate-private
`https_credentials` accessor), `src/vault_runtime_state.rs` (the durable
per-Vault Git-turn record `ManagedGitScheduler` reads at activation and
writes after each interval-arming turn), `src/vault_management.rs` (which
renders `polling_clock` as a Vault summary's `last_checked_at`/
`next_attempt_at`), `src/handlers/settings.rs`, HTTP/MCP write
adapters, configuration, frontend settings UI, and vault watcher Git
exclusions.

**Invariants:** optional and debounced; a commit turn never opens a network
connection, whatever the Vault's mode; writes do not block on sync, except
while a managed-Git or `ExistingGit` remote-sync turn, or a Two-way commit
turn, is in flight for that Vault, see below; task replacement drains
before another task can start;
local mode never contacts a remote; remote mode never force-checks out over
uncommitted manual vault edits (ADR-10). Managed acquisition never writes
credentials to URLs, Git configuration, reads, logs, errors, or status; it
never deletes, overwrites, or silently adopts a checkout destination. The
managed-Git scheduler adds no persisted queue, priority, or second execution
lane (ADR-13); a Git turn's returned failure always completes that Vault's
turn so the shared worker is released for the next Vault. A `ManagedGit` or
`ExistingGit` `PullOnly`/`TwoWay` Git turn holds `VaultControlBlock::acquire_mutation`
for its whole blocking duration (issue #96's reopening defect 2), so it can
never race a foreground Markdown write's own hold of the same lock — this is
the exception to "writes do not block on sync" above, scoped to exactly the
Vault whose turn is running; this is coarser than the legacy single-Vault
task's fine-grained per-phase locking (which releases across network-only
fetch/push), a deliberate trade favoring a small, low-risk diff over matching
that finer discipline. `commit_vault_drift` preserves an
operator's already-staged Vault-subtree index content across a Two-way
commit rather than overwriting it with working-tree drift (issue #96's
reopening defect 3), mirroring `sync.rs`'s `commit_working_tree`.

**Validation:** `cargo test git`, `cargo test managed_checkout`, and affected
adapter/server tests. Managed graph changes additionally run `cargo test
managed_sync` against local bare-repository fixtures; scheduling changes run
`cargo test managed_task`, `cargo test vault_runtime_state`, and `cargo test
vault_runtime`.

### HTTP adapters

**Kind:** adapter.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/handlers/mod.rs`
- `src/handlers/api.rs`
- `src/handlers/assets.rs`
- `src/handlers/diagnostics.rs`
- `src/handlers/downloads.rs`
- `src/handlers/settings.rs`
- `src/handlers/spa.rs`
- `src/handlers/vault_collection_reads.rs`
- `src/handlers/vault_content.rs`
- `src/handlers/vault_write.rs`
- `src/handlers/vaults.rs`

**Public contract:** handler functions intentionally re-exported by
`src/handlers/mod.rs`; their route, authentication, status, and serialized HTTP
behavior — and nothing else. The one non-handler seam this module used to export
for the MCP `get_attachment` tool (#176) went with #188: attachment resolution,
the servable-extension allow-list, the content-type table, and the size bound
now belong to the read core (`src/vault_read/assets.rs`), which applies
`VaultReadCore`'s browse-surface gating to them, so both surfaces refuse the
same paths. What `assets.rs` keeps is this route's own wire shaping.
`settings.rs` owns the additive `/api/settings` document: effective
value/provenance/lock/class/kind metadata and partial PATCH saves returning the
full refreshed document. MCP enablement and its bearer token validate together
against one prospective snapshot, so an invalid combination saves nothing and
reports field errors. Its candidate-token and capability-safe secret-reveal
endpoints are `no-store`; the ordinary settings document never exposes secret
values. A save whose consequence needs consent (a reindex, initializing local
history, or downgrading away from remote versioning) is refused with `409` and
a machine-readable `confirmation_required` consequence — the server is the
authority, and sends no prose; the page owns the words and resends with a
`confirm` list. `reindex` is the only consequence: #183 retired `git_init` and
`git_downgrade` with the instance-wide Versioning console that explained them,
and #185 removed the repository work they described, so a `HATCHDOOR_GIT_*`
save now only persists a value. Saves persist before rebuilding. A confirmed indexing-setting save requests one Index turn per
active Vault through the shared work coordinator
(`app_state::request_collection_reindex`), never the legacy instance-wide
rebuild: each Vault reports its own `indexing` condition and keeps serving
reads from its previous snapshot until its new one is published, and a
disabled Vault has no active runtime so it is not queued.
A save that flips
`HATCHDOOR_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED` — the only setting that adds or removes tools
from the advertised catalogue — broadcasts
`AppState::mcp_tools_changed` so subscribed MCP sessions re-list; a
layer-marker change does not, because no tool schema is derived from it.
Every save takes one path: the legacy versioning-task lifecycle branch (stop
the task, preflight the repository, respawn) went with the task itself in
#185. `HATCHDOOR_GIT_SYNC_ENABLED`, `_REMOTE`, `_BRANCH`, `_HTTPS_USERNAME`,
`_HTTPS_TOKEN`, `_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS`, and `HATCHDOOR_EXCLUDE` remain in the
schema as first-boot import inputs (`vault_migration.rs` consumes them until
#82 closes). No per-operation code reads them; two `server.rs` startup checks
still parse them — `check_demo_mode_posture` and `HATCHDOOR_EXCLUDE`'s pattern
validation — and both only refuse a start.
`HATCHDOOR_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`_EMAIL` remain
the commit-identity fallback the collection lane's Git turns read per turn, so
a change to them still reaches the next turn without a restart.

`vaults.rs` is the HTTP adapter over **Vault collection management**: it owns
the `/api/v1/vaults` routes — discovery, collection management (create/edit/
enable/disable/disconnect), manual Git sync/retry, one-Vault Index refresh, the
confirmed `start-with-no-vaults` recovery, and the collection-wide SSE event
stream — and nothing else. Since #187 each route parses its own path, query,
and body, calls `vault_management::VaultCollectionManagement` once, and maps
the typed response or the structured `VaultOperationError` onto a status code
and a JSON body. The registry commit, the runtime reconciliation, the
authenticated and demo projections, the starter-Vault seeding, the
credential-replacement Git retry, and the recovery action all live in that
core, shared with the MCP management tools, which no longer proxy these
handlers.

This is the first `/api/v1` surface, and it carries no instance-wide readiness
gate: discovery and creating the first Vault stay reachable at zero enabled
Vaults, and discovery reports an explicit `recovery` object rather than erroring
when the persisted registry itself needs operator recovery. Every response uses
the shared `VaultApiError{code, message, vault_id?, retryable}` shape — the
adapter spelling of the core's `VaultOperationError` — and reuses
`vault_registry::VaultSource`/`VaultGitMode` directly on the wire rather than
duplicating them.

The status mapping is the whole of this adapter's error contract, asserted
directly by `every_management_error_code_keeps_its_historical_status`:
`invalid_vault_id`/`invalid_vault_definition`/`confirmation_required` are
`400`; `vault_not_found` is `404`; the registry-state conflicts
(`duplicate_vault_name`, `vault_path_overlap`, the two identity-change
refusals, `registry_revision_conflict`,
`legacy_migration_recovery_not_pending`, `vault_disabled`,
`capability_unavailable`) are `409`; `vault_registry_recovery_required`,
`legacy_environment_cleanup_required`, and `vault_unavailable` are `503`; and
`internal_error`/`registry_revision_exhausted` are `500`. On top of that the
adapter adds the two statuses the core does not model: `201` for a creation and
`202` for admitted background work. `internal_error` is logged and sanitized by
the core, so nothing here re-reports it.

Discovery and the event stream are pure reads and stay reachable in demo mode
(#109: demo mode publishes every enabled Vault in the instance as a public
read-only collection, unlike `settings.rs`'s operator-controls posture, which
remains absent), where the core answers with its public projection. Collection
management, manual Git sync/retry, and one-Vault Index refresh are
Vault-control operations, so `src/server.rs` wraps each of their routes —
individually, since some share a path with a read (`POST /api/v1/vaults`
alongside `GET`) — in `reject_demo_mutation`, which calls this file's
`demo_read_only_response` to refuse with a shared `403 demo_read_only`
`VaultApiError` before any registry mutation runs, rather than being absent.
That refusal body and the SSE stream's `Event` framing are the two things that
stay here because they are transport with no MCP counterpart; the stream's
underlying revision channel is obtained from the core's `subscribe_revisions`
rather than from the runtime directly.

`vault_content.rs` owns exact Vault-scoped content reads and their contained
resources, mounted in the same `/api/v1/vaults/{vault_id}/...` router group as
`vaults.rs` and sharing its demo-mode/auth posture, `VaultApiError` (including
its `new`/`respond` constructors, widened to `pub(crate)`), and
rejection-mapping helpers (`parse_vault_id`, `json_rejection_response`,
`query_rejection_response`, `internal_error_response`, widened to
`pub(crate)` for this reuse): `GET .../notes/{slug}`, `GET
.../notes/{slug}/links`, `GET .../notes/{slug}/download`, `GET .../resolve`,
`POST .../resolve-batch` (whose request additionally takes optional
`asset_targets` and `note_path`, answered by an `asset_results` array of
`{target, path}`, `path` null when nothing matched — additive, so a client
resolving note links only sees exactly what it saw before, and the batch cap
counts both target lists), `GET .../assets/{*path}` (serving both embedded
assets and imported attachments, which share one containment rule; mounted
outside `vaults_v1`'s web-token-only gate, under
`require_web_or_live_mcp_read_token`, so `get_attachment`'s advertised
`download_url` is fetchable with the MCP credential), and `GET
.../stats/detail` (#137's rich per-Vault statistics report). Every route but
the last always inspects the requested Vault's authoritative Markdown
directory through `VaultReadCore`, never the disposable cache; `stats/detail`
is the sole exception, reading the same published snapshot the collection
`{scope}/stats` route reads (word/mtime/size data `VaultReadCore`'s
authoritative-index path does not carry), so it can briefly lag a write the
way collection reads do, unlike every other route here. Exact reads run all blocking
filesystem/index work off the async runtime via the read core's `VaultReads`
handle (one trip per request, not one per batch entry or per path-resolution
step), and are gated per-request by that Vault's own
`vault_not_found`/`vault_disabled`/`vault_unavailable` status rather than any
single-configured-Vault readiness gate. Since #188 asset resolution is the
core's (`VaultReadCore::contained_asset`); what is left in `assets.rs` is this
route's own wire shaping — the success response's headers and the HTTP status
each `AssetPathError` carries — and `downloads.rs` still owns export and
download-response building (`build_note_export`, `download_response`).

`vault_collection_reads.rs` owns one-or-all collection reads and search:
`GET /api/v1/vaults/{scope}/tree`, `.../recent`, `.../stats`, `.../graph`, and
`.../search`, mounted in the same router group and sharing the same
demo-mode/auth posture, `VaultApiError` shape, and `query_rejection_response`/
`vault_read_error_response` (the latter widened to `pub(crate)` in
`vault_content.rs` and extended with `invalid_search_query`/
`invalid_layer_selection` (`400`) and `search_unavailable` (`503`) arms for
reuse here) rather than duplicating them. `{scope}` reuses the path segment
name `vault_id` for router-tree consistency with every sibling route in this
group, parsed by the core's `VaultScope::parse` into either a Vault ID or
`VaultScope::All`; anything else is the structured `invalid_scope` error
(`400`). Since #188 that parser, the `layers` grammar, and the limit/per-note
clamps live in the core so the MCP tools apply exactly the same ones. This file is a thin adapter with no collection-read domain logic of
its own: `tree`/`stats`/`graph` return `vault_read.rs`'s existing
`VaultReadCore::{trees, statistics, graphs}` projections unchanged (grouped
per Vault); `recent` returns `recently_modified` (flattened across Vaults);
`search` returns `search::vault_scoped::VaultSearchCore::search`'s projection
(flattened, one global ranking). `search`'s `layers` query parameter is a
comma-separated token list parsed by `BrowseSurface::layer_selection`
into a `LayerSelection` applied identically to every participant — unlike
`search::LayerSelection::parse` (built for the single-Vault MCP surface, where
an unrecognized token degrades to the default surface), it does not consult
any one Vault's known-layer catalog while parsing, since a name valid in one
Vault and absent from another is expected, not an error; only a name absent
from *every* usable participant is (`VaultSearchCore::search`'s own
`invalid_layer_selection` check).

`vault_write.rs` owns exactly-one-Vault Markdown mutations, attachment
upload, and write-capabilities discovery, retiring the entire legacy unscoped
application API in the same change (#101): `POST .../notes`, `PUT
.../notes/{slug}`, `PATCH .../notes/{slug}/rename|move|move-rename|archive`,
`DELETE .../notes/{slug}`, `POST .../attachments` (mounted separately from the
rest of this group so it can also accept a live MCP bearer token, mirroring
the retired `/api/attachment` route), and `GET .../write-capabilities`. Since
#186 every one of those eight routes has ADR-19's shape: it parses its path
and body, calls `VaultMutationCore` once, and maps the typed outcome or the
structured `VaultOperationError` onto a status code — including this surface's
own sanitizing of a `write_failed` message into the generic internal error,
and its own operator-facing `warnings` on the capabilities route, which fold
in the instance's web-auth posture the core knows nothing about. No route here
holds gating, locking, index-build, entry-lookup, marker or noise refusal,
archive-prefix, or write-error-translation logic; each of those steps has
exactly one implementation, in `vault_mutation.rs`, shared with the MCP write
tools. Archive prefix and attachment size limit stay instance-wide settings
(issue #62), read via `AppState::runtime_snapshot`/`runtime_archive_prefix`/
`runtime_mcp_config`. A mutation response omits `git_sync_warning`: the
managed-Git scheduler has no debounced-on-write hook, unlike the retired
instance-wide sync task, so there is nothing per-write to report that Vault
discovery does not already expose. `vaults.rs` owns the
additive authenticated `POST /api/v1/vaults/{vault_id}/refresh` control: it
requires one enabled Vault with usable local Markdown, asks
`VaultWorkCoordinator` for `VaultWorkKind::Index`, and returns its immediate
`202 VaultScheduleResponse` acknowledgement (`queued` or `coalesced`) without
waiting for a snapshot build. It uses the shared `VaultApiError` conventions
for malformed IDs, missing/disabled Vaults, unavailable local capability, and
coordinator rejection; the migration guide documents external clients. The
legacy unscoped refresh and all-Vault refresh remain absent. `diagnostics`
remains retired because it needs new per-Vault cache-query domain methods.

Every route here is a content mutation, attachment upload, or write-capability
discovery, so `src/server.rs` wraps each one — individually, since Markdown
mutations share a path with a read (`PUT`/`DELETE .../notes/{slug}` alongside
`GET`) — in `reject_demo_mutation` (#109): in demo mode it refuses with
`vaults.rs`'s shared `403 demo_read_only` error before any mutation runs,
unlike `vault_content.rs`'s exact reads and `vault_collection_reads.rs`'s
one-or-all reads, which are pure reads and stay reachable in demo mode.

The attachment upload is the one route that still reads its own body:
`vault_write.rs` binds one live configuration snapshot *before* consuming any
multipart field and reads each field incrementally against its fail-closed
byte limit, so lowering the limit takes effect on the next request rather than
after the bytes are already buffered; an invalid pinned upload limit never
falls back to a larger default. That streaming discipline has to stay where
the bytes arrive, so the core exposes the import primitive over already-decoded
bytes rather than over a stream. A `WriteError` carrying recovery guidance
reaches the client as `write_recovery_required` rather than collapsing into
the sanitized generic internal error. `vault_content.rs` bounds Vault asset
and generated note-download responses so these convenience endpoints are not
unbounded transfer buffers; an over-limit asset or export receives the shared
`VaultApiError` shape and `413 Payload Too Large`.

**Consumed dependencies:** `AppState`, HTTP wire types, vault reads,
`vault/write`, Search, cache queries, Git status, auth, and — for `vaults.rs`
only — the Vault collection registry's mutation/load operations,
`VaultCollectionRuntime::{snapshot, reconcile_and_reconstruct,
subscribe_revisions}`, `VaultWorkCoordinator`, and
`ManagedGitScheduler::{sync_now, retry_now}` and `VaultWorkCoordinator::request`
via `AppState::{vault_work, managed_git}`. `vault_content.rs` is the first HTTP consumer of
Vault-qualified read projections (`vault_read.rs`'s `VaultReadCore`, including
its `vault_directory` accessor); `vault_collection_reads.rs` is the first HTTP
consumer of that core's collection-read projections and of
`search::vault_scoped::VaultSearchCore`. `vault_write.rs` consumes the
Vault-qualified mutation core (`vault_mutation.rs`) and nothing else on the
write side: every `vault/write` primitive, `VaultControlBlock` lock, and
`VaultReadCore` gate it used to reach for directly now reaches it through that
core.

**Consumers:** route construction in `src/server.rs`; the MCP boundary's
`get_attachment` read tool, through the asset seam named in the public contract
above.

**Coordination paths:** `src/server.rs`, `src/api_types.rs`, frontend clients,
and whichever domain a handler adapts.

**Invariants:** handlers stay thin. Write handlers never touch the vault
filesystem directly (ADR-03). Static and vault asset behavior must retain auth
and path containment. `vaults.rs` never returns HTTPS credentials, only
`credential_configured` (ADR-01/registry invariant); disconnect deletes no
files, checkouts, Git history, or credentials outside the registry record.

**Validation:** `cargo test handlers`, router tests, and affected domain tests.

### MCP adapter

**Status:** Implemented per [ADR-17](../../adr/README.md) (#168): rmcp 3.x
(pinned `rmcp = "=3.1.4"`) owns the `/mcp` transport and the advertised
revisions are exactly `2026-07-28` and `2025-11-25`; #170 adds honest
`tools.listChanged` on the modern surface. The remaining Wayfinder children
build on this seam: #171 (layered rate limits) and #172 (release evidence).
#177 adds `batch`: one generic tool that executes a caller-supplied ordered
list of note/attachment operations (`create_note` through `delete_attachment`,
plus every read tool except `list_vaults`) in a single call, dispatching each
item through the exact same `read`/`write` tool functions a standalone call
uses. Vault-management ops and unrecognized op names are rejected up front,
before any item executes; over the asymmetric per-batch caps in
`src/mcp/limits.rs` (`BATCH_MAX_READ_ITEMS` = 50, `BATCH_MAX_WRITE_ITEMS` =
20) the whole call is refused the same way. Execution is best-effort and in
order — one item's failure never stops the rest, and there is no rollback —
with `expected_content_hash` chaining between items in the same call that
share a `(vault_id, slug)`: `mcp/tools/batch.rs` tracks each note's resulting
hash as the batch runs and substitutes it for a later item's own
`expected_content_hash`, so a caller can create or edit a note earlier in the
batch and reference it again later without an intermediate read; a note not
otherwise touched in the batch still validates its `expected_content_hash`
normally. No Git-specific handling exists in the tool: it writes Markdown
files exactly as the standalone tools do, and the existing per-Vault Git
turn (`commit_vault_drift`, `src/git/managed_sync.rs`) already commits
whatever is dirty at that turn in one commit — a batch's writes therefore
land in one commit the same way any burst of individual write calls would,
without changing ADR-10's debounced background-sync semantics. Catalogue
grows 38 → 39, purely additive. #228 adds `refresh_vault`, the eighth Vault
management tool: a write-gated mapping onto the collection management core's
`refresh`, which admits one Vault's next Index turn and returns its
`VaultScheduleResponse` (`queued`, or `coalesced` when a turn for that Vault is
already pending). It exists so a client reading a collection read's `partial:
true` with a `stale` participant can act on it, which `sync_vault` and
`retry_vault` cannot: both are Git controls, and since #267 they refuse
`capability_unavailable` only on a Vault with no Git at all (a `Local`
source), admitting a commit turn on a Vault that has no remote but does keep
history. It is rejected inside
`batch` like every other management tool, and is deliberately *not* in
`is_collection_management_tool`: that exemption keeps discovery and Vault
control reachable while model setup is pending, and an Index turn cannot run
without a configured search model. Catalogue grows 39 → 40, purely additive.

**Kind:** adapter/security surface.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/mcp/mod.rs`
- `src/mcp/adapter.rs`
- `src/mcp/auth.rs`
- `src/mcp/config.rs`
- `src/mcp/protocol.rs`
- `src/mcp/results.rs`
- `src/mcp/routes.rs`
- `src/mcp/subscriptions.rs`
- `src/mcp/limits.rs`
- `src/mcp/tools/mod.rs`
- `src/mcp/tools/read.rs`
- `src/mcp/tools/write.rs`
- `src/mcp/tools/batch.rs`

**Public contract (target):** `/mcp` is Streamable HTTP served through rmcp's
`StreamableHttpService` (GET/SSE + POST + DELETE). Legacy `2025-11-25` traffic
keeps today's POST-only request/response shape and initialize/negotiation flow;
modern clients additionally open GET/SSE streams for server-initiated delivery.
Modern clients are stateless with no initialization handshake: `server/discover`
replaces `initialize`, each request carries per-request `_meta` that must match
the required protocol/capability HTTP headers, and `Mcp-Method`/`Mcp-Name`
validation is enforced. Advertised protocol revisions are exactly `2026-07-28`
and `2025-11-25`; older revisions are not negotiated.
Once #170 lands, the modern surface advertises `tools.listChanged: true`
honestly: modern clients receive tool-list change events via
`subscriptions/listen` backed by the existing `mcp_tools_changed` broadcast,
capped at four live subscriptions per bearer token (`subscriptions.rs` owns
the per-token registry and the validated-token request extension), with
acknowledgment, subscription metadata, rmcp SSE keep-alives, and disconnect
cancellation. The legacy handshake keeps advertising `tools.listChanged:
false`, so legacy clients continue reissuing `tools/list`. Layered resource protection (#171) exempts protocol/discovery/
list handling from the tool quota, limits tool calls to 120/minute/token and
concurrency to eight ordinary / two expensive searches, rejects over-limit
requests with HTTP 429 + `Retry-After`, and is explicitly disableable by
configuration (`HATCHDOOR_MCP_RATE_LIMITS_ENABLED`; `limits.rs` owns the quota
window, the concurrency pools, and the POST classification). Every tool response is a typed Rust result structure whose type
generates the `outputSchema` advertised in `tools/list` (#167), for the full
40-tool catalogue.
Internal JSON-RPC failures expose the stable `Internal server error` message
while the adapter logs diagnostics. `McpConfig`, server instructions, tool
names/schemas/results, and `HatchdoorMcpTransport` (the rmcp-backed transport
with its authorization/body-limit middleware) remain the boundary's public
surface; `adapter.rs` implements rmcp's `ServerHandler` seam over the
dispatcher, and `routes.rs` mounts it.
`list_vaults` exposes the shared redacted
Vault discovery/status/capability and revision shape. `get_tree` is the one
collection read that names more: since #192 it also takes optional `folder`,
`max_depth` and `include_notes`, so it no longer shares the scope-only schema
builder with `get_stats` and `get_graph`, whose schemas are unchanged. It maps
those three onto the read core's `TreeScope` and nothing else; the narrowing
itself, and the `folder_not_found` refusal, belong to the core. Every collection read
names `scope` (one Vault ID or `all`); every exact read, Markdown mutation, and
existing-Vault control names `vault_id`. Revisioned registry management calls the
Vault collection management core directly (#187) rather than proxying an HTTP
handler, and answers with the same shared collection shapes HTTP returns;
`create_vault` is the only zero-ID exception because the registry atomically
generates its immutable ID. MCP
returns shared domain failures as structured error tool results. Since #255
such a result signals its failure twice: `isError` on the result object, and
`ok: false` inside the structured payload beside the domain error's own `code`,
`message`, `retryable`, and optional `vault_id`. The two signals are
independent, so a client reading only the structured payload can still tell a
refusal from a success. Reading it that way is what the advertised
`outputSchema` invites, since that schema describes the success shape alone.
`src/mcp/protocol.rs`'s
`tool_structured_error` is the only place that marker is set, and the shared
Vault error type is deliberately not the carrier: it also serialises into HTTP
bodies and into `batch` item `error` values, neither of which changes shape.
No scope-less/default/sole-Vault tool remains reachable.
`get_attachment_import_config` names one Vault and answers under every write
posture, reporting the instance-wide write switch and that Vault's own
mutation capability as separate fields rather than refusing the call.
Typed results live in `src/mcp/results.rs`: each tool's success response is
produced from one Rust structure — MCP-owned shapes there, the read core's own
projections aliased for the Vault reads, and Vault collection management's wire
types for the registry controls — and that same structure generates the tool's
advertised `outputSchema`. Since #188 every read tool serializes that
projection exactly once, straight from the core; the decode-and-re-serialize
round trip through a proxied HTTP response body, and its 2 MiB cap, are gone.
`list_note_attachments` is a read tool on the read catalogue, reachable without
MCP write permission and without the mutation capability, as is
`get_frontmatter` — a body-free tags/aliases/properties projection of one note
served from the same authoritative Markdown read, carrying that note's
`content_hash` beside its other identity fields (#227) so a caller can prepare
a hash-protected write at frontmatter cost rather than reading every body.
`get_attachment` is the
outbound counterpart to `import_attachment`'s inbound flow, addressed by the
same `relative_path` `list_note_attachments` reports: `encoding: "url"` (the
default) returns an HTTP `download_url` under the existing Vault-scoped
`/assets/{*path}` route, and `encoding: "base64"` inlines the bytes instead,
bounded by the same `HATCHDOOR_MCP_MAX_BASE64_BYTES` cap `import_attachment`
enforces on the way in. Resolution goes through
`VaultReadCore::contained_asset` (#188), so the Vault gate, containment, the
extension allow-list, the content type, and the browse surface are the same
ones the `/assets/{*path}` route answers on — a demoted or excluded asset is
refused identically on both surfaces, rather than MCP bypassing the surface
policy as it did while it reached into `handlers/assets.rs` directly. The
advertised `download_url` carries no credential of its own, but the route it
points at accepts this MCP session's own bearer token while MCP is enabled, as
well as the web bearer token — see the auth boundary's public contract for why
the read direction is gated differently from the upload direction.
`update_frontmatter` is a
write tool over `vault/write`'s shallow top-level YAML merge primitive
(`update_note_frontmatter`): explicit null deletes a key, unmentioned keys
survive, nested mappings replace wholesale, and the body outside the leading
frontmatter block stays byte-for-byte unchanged. `create_vault` and
`edit_vault` advertise the `VaultSource` and credential contracts as
per-variant schemas rather than opaque objects; `edit_vault` replaces a
definition wholesale, and only its credential patch preserves a stored value
across an edit.

Each MCP request validates its live configuration, token, and Origin before
the body is collected. Read-only MCP accepts only the small ordinary JSON-RPC
request bound; write-enabled requests may use the current base64-attachment
allowance plus bounded JSON framing. Invalid pinned attachment limits fail
closed rather than widening to defaults. JSON-RPC replies are also bounded; an
oversized reply becomes a bounded protocol error rather than an unbounded
response buffer. Blocking work — index builds, snapshot reads, query embedding,
and filesystem reads — runs off the async runtime for every tool, through the
read core's own `VaultReads` offload rather than a per-adapter prologue.

**Consumed dependencies:** `AppState`, the four Vault-qualified cores
(`VaultReadCore`/`VaultReads`, `VaultSearchCore`, the Vault mutation core, and
Vault collection management), Vault registry/runtime, model setup, attachment
limits, and the live configuration snapshot bound at each request. No HTTP
adapter is consumed: since #188 no file under `src/mcp/` imports
`crate::handlers`, and ADR-19's MCP-to-handler proxying debt is retired.

**Coordination paths:** `src/server.rs`, domains exposed as tools, and
documentation describing agent behavior.

**Invariants:** MCP is disabled by default, uses its own token, validates
Origins, and keeps read-only access credentialed (ADR-09); the wire transport
itself is rmcp-owned rather than hand-implemented, and the advertised revision
set stays narrowed to `2026-07-28` + `2025-11-25` (ADR-17). Per-request security
ordering is preserved across the swap: enabled check → token-configured check →
Origin allowlist → constant-time bearer compare → protocol-version header.
The MCP bearer token is accepted by the multipart attachment endpoint only while
MCP *and* MCP write mode are both live-enabled, checked per request; token
changes, write enablement, Origins, and attachment limits apply to the next
request, and attachment authorization never retains a rotated MCP token.

Since #186 every one of the fifteen write tools has ADR-19's shape: it
validates its own arguments and then calls the Vault-qualified mutation core
once, mapping the typed outcome or the structured `VaultOperationError` onto a
tool result or a JSON-RPC failure. Two meanings live only here — a target path
this instance will not write (noise-excluded, or the reserved
`.hatchdoor-layer` marker) stays an `invalid_params` error, and an
instance-side failure an internal one whose detail this surface, unlike HTTP,
reports. `vault/write`, the `acquire_mutation` lock, the index build, the slug
lookup, the archive prefix, optimistic concurrency, and the path protections
(ADR-03) are all reached through that core, so both surfaces share one
implementation of each. Every write also runs off the async runtime, because
the core offloads it for every caller; before #184 this surface ran them
inline while HTTP offloaded them. `scoped_vault` gates with the core's own
`ensure_mutable`, and `acquire_mutation` takes the core's lock; the dispatcher
keeps holding that guard itself (`mod.rs` for one tool call, `batch.rs` for a
whole batch call on one Vault) because a batch's critical section is wider
than any single operation. `batch` is a loop over that same per-item dispatch,
with its `expected_content_hash` chaining and its asymmetric read/write caps
unchanged.

Since #188 the read tools have the same shape, in `tools/read.rs`: parse the
arguments, call `VaultReadCore`, `VaultSearchCore`, or Vault collection
management once through the core's offload, and map the typed projection or the
structured failure onto a tool result. `list_note_attachments`,
`get_attachment`, `get_frontmatter`, and `get_attachment_import_config` moved
out of `tools/write.rs` with that change, and the local index build, slug
lookup, and raw asset resolution they kept there are gone.

What stays in this adapter is what only this transport knows: its own argument
names and empty-field wording, the `new_title` path-separator rule, the
`replace_section` mode spelling, the base64 encoding option on
`get_attachment`, and `import_attachment`'s base64 envelope —
whitespace-tolerant, capped on the *encoded* length before it is decoded, with
the core then applying the authoritative check to the decoded bytes.

**Validation:** `cargo test mcp`, vault write tests for mutation changes,
server router tests, and golden wire tests locking both supported revisions'
request/response shapes. Before releases, the manual conformance-run procedure
(#166) produces mandatory release evidence.

### Evaluation and development binaries

**Kind:** offline tooling; not a runtime feature.

**Owned paths:**

- `src/eval/mod.rs`
- `src/eval/compare_runner.rs`
- `src/eval/hybrid_runner.rs`
- `src/eval/metrics.rs`
- `src/eval/query.rs`
- `src/eval/report.rs`
- `src/eval/rerank_runner.rs`
- `src/bin/eval.rs`
- `src/bin/index_microbench.rs`

**Public contract:** evaluation query JSONL, metrics/report formats, CLI
arguments, and reproducible comparison behavior. Every cache-querying CLI mode
(`run`, `rerank`, `hybrid`, and `compare`) validates the exact stamped
`Embedder::identity()` before querying; an absent or unequal identity requires
a disposable-cache rebuild. Rerank reports preserve heading paths and publish
correct-heading plus category/tier/language slices alongside post-rerank
quality metrics. `index_microbench` validates the active representation stamp
and labels the representation it measures. Both binaries declare
`required-features = ["eval"]`, so every documented invocation carries
`--features eval`.

**Consumed dependencies:** cache, embeddings, chunking, Search, and Reranking,
plus the `eval`-gated candle stack (`candle-core`, FastEmbed's `qwen3` and
`nomic-v2-moe` features, and the version-matched `tokenizers-fe` alias).

**Coordination paths:** `eval/**`, `Cargo.toml`'s `eval` feature and `[[bin]]`
entries, the contributor guide's verification commands, related findings under
`docs/`, and model or chunking code when experiments become runtime decisions.

**Invariants:** hybrid and rerank experiments remain offline unless ADR-05 is
superseded; the harness stays behind the non-default `eval` feature, so no
default, verification, or production build compiles a crate that only the
harness reaches. Crates a production dependency also needs are unaffected:
`fastembed` requires tokenizers 0.22 unconditionally, so that second tokenizers
version stays in the default tree even though Hatchdoor's own edge to it is now
`eval`-only.

**Validation:** `cargo test eval`, binary argument tests, and the relevant eval
command for behavioral changes. Because a default `cargo test --all` skips both
binaries' test targets entirely, the guide's second run,
`cargo test --all --all-features`, is what keeps them from rotting.

## Frontend

The frontend currently uses technical-layer directories rather than enforced
feature boundaries. The ownership below assigns each production file to one
capability or marks it shared. Except for Search's TS/TSX façade rule,
boundaries are currently documentation-enforced.

### Application shell and navigation

**Kind:** composition/shared.

**Owned paths:** none by default.

**Paths:**

- `frontend/src/main.tsx`
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/AppTopbar.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/ExplorerPane.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/vaultSlot.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/vaultSlotLogic.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/vaultAccordion.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/constants.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useIsMobile.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useTheme.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useVaultScope.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/storage.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/StartWithNoVaultsDialog.tsx`

**Contract and responsibility:** bootstraps React/router/PWA, composes feature
hooks and routes, owns responsive shell state, navigation, persistent shell
preferences, topbar actions, and explorer placement. Before the tree ever
renders, `main.tsx` calls `lib/writeDrafts.ts`'s `collectLegacyHeldDrafts`
and `lib/storage.ts`'s `clearLegacyNoteScopedBrowserState` (#151) once,
synchronously — the one-time post-#137 sweep and browser-state cleanup, so
every component's first render already reflects them regardless of which
route mounts first. `clearLegacyNoteScopedBrowserState` removes Recent
notes, the last note opened, unfolded explorer folders, and explorer scroll
position — state that named a note or folder before Vault qualification and
cannot be trusted to mean the same one after — guarded by the persisted
`LEGACY_BROWSER_STATE_CLEARED_KEY` marker so it never repeats over state a
returning user has legitimately rebuilt since; six Vault-agnostic
preferences (theme, sidebar width, drawer open state, Recent notes'
collapsed state, the touch-edit hint, the stored bearer token) are untouched.
`useVaultScope.ts` owns
the selected Vault scope (state/storage, per #137) and the Vault-less-action
default (`resolvePrimaryVaultId`); the Vault collection itself belongs to the
Vault collection client below (#198). `app/ExplorerPane.tsx`'s Scope zone (#138) calls
`setScope` on the desktop; `app/AppTopbar.tsx`'s scope row and its bottom
sheet (#145) call it below 920px, where the Scope zone itself does not
render. The breakpoint keeps the two callers mutually exclusive — every other
collection-read and Vault-picking call site only reads the selected scope.
`vaultSlot.tsx`/`vaultSlotLogic.ts` (#139) derive each Vault's trailing
count-or-condition slot and the shared All-Vaults/collapsed-head aggregate
from `VaultSummary`'s status fields alone — no new endpoint.
`vaultSlotLogic.ts`'s `deriveVaultSlot` is also imported by Note reading's
`NotePage.tsx` (#141) to detect a write-blocking Git condition on the open
note's own Vault; this is a deliberate cross-capability import of one pure
function rather than a duplicated copy of the condition vocabulary.
Note counts reach the slot from the
collection client, which reads them at `"all"` scope independently of the
browsing scope and refreshes them on the collection revision. The topbar's `Tree Stale` badge is deleted (#139) with
nothing replacing it; `Offline` is the only condition left there, because it
is about the workspace and not about any one Vault.
`app/vaultAccordion.ts` (#142) is `app/ExplorerPane.tsx`'s per-Vault
accordion under `all`: pure derivation for the landing default (the open
note's own Vault, else the last persisted, else nothing), the unavailable-
Vault unfold gate, the `LAST_UNFOLDED_VAULT_KEY` persistence pair, and the
per-Vault namespacing of the shared `expandedFolders` record the accordion's
folder-open memory needs. Unfolding a Vault never calls `setScope`, same
invariant as the Scope zone's own narrow-scope call being the only one.

Narrowing the scope to one Vault also moves the reader. `App.tsx`'s
`handleScopeChange` wraps `setScope` at both call sites and, when the reader
is on a note route, navigates to the note that Vault was last left on, or to
`"/"` when that Vault has none remembered. `lib/storage.ts` holds that memory
under `LAST_NOTE_BY_VAULT_KEY` as `vaultId -> slug`, written alongside
`LAST_NOTE_KEY` whenever the open note changes and pruned to the browsing
list whenever discovery settles, for the reason `clearStoredLastNote` exists:
a Vault that is gone or paused only resolves to "Vault definition was not
found". An empty browsing list never triggers that prune, since a broken
registry produces one too and it is not evidence that anything departed.
`LAST_NOTE_KEY` stays the single landing note the `"/"` redirect and the
accordion's landing default read. Four cases move nobody: widening back to
`all`, picking the Vault whose note is already open, an unchanged pick, and a
pick made anywhere but a note route (Settings, Graph, Statistics, the empty
landing), where the scope is a filter rather than a request to go and read
something; the note route is matched with the router's own `useMatch`, not a
second spelling of the path. A switch that lands on `"/"` clears
`LAST_NOTE_KEY` as it goes: nothing is open any more, so the landing redirect
finds nothing to put back, now or after a reload. What it does not do is
check that a remembered note still exists — a note deleted since is a
not-found page that heals as soon as any note in that Vault is opened, the
same bargain the landing redirect already makes.

The Scope zone renders at zero enabled Vaults too, not only above one
(#150): `All Vaults` holds its place with no rows beneath it, in neutral
ink, rather than disappearing along with the last Vault. It remains absent
at exactly one enabled Vault where narrowing has nothing to offer, except
while first-run startup progress needs its slot. Its
collapsed-head and `All Vaults`-row slots also take an optional
`startupProgress` (`StartupProgress`, exported from this file) that
replaces the ordinary aggregate while the shrunk startup gate reports
`scanning`/`indexing`, reusing the per-Vault "indexing" slot's animated-bar
visual language. `App.tsx`'s `"/"` route similarly branches on genuine zero
Vaults (a neutral `Add a Vault` empty state; the action itself is Settings'
`VaultCreationDialog` (#153) — this route has no room for the flow, so
`ZeroVaultState`'s `onAddVault` navigates to `/settings` with
`{state: {openVaultCreation: true}}` instead, absent entirely in demo mode via
the collection client's `demoMode` — a demo instance's own
description reads "This demo has no Vaults loaded." in that state (#152),
never the ordinary "Add a Vault…" sentence with nothing left to act on it)
versus a broken start:
The collection client
also exposes `recovery` (the persisted registry file is unreadable) and
`legacyMigrationRecovery` (the registry loaded fine but a failed safe
legacy import needs recovery) — mutually exclusive, both rendering the same
documented error block with a `Try again` action (a plain re-fetch), and
`legacyMigrationRecovery` additionally offering `components/StartWithNoVaultsDialog.tsx`'s
once-confirmed `Start with no Vaults` action against the new
`POST /api/v1/vaults/start-with-no-vaults` endpoint.

A demo instance is a faithful Hatchdoor with the operator removed, not one
with its controls greyed out (#152): `App.tsx`'s `"/settings"` route renders
`<Navigate to="/" replace>` instead of `SettingsPage` whenever `demoMode` is
true — silently, like every other withheld operator affordance, rather than
disabled-and-explained — which is what makes Vault management, `Add a
Vault`, Git behaviour/credential controls, `Sync now`, and `Unsaved drafts`
disappear together in one place instead of needing separate gates inside
`features/settings/**` (whose own vault-scoped reads stay reachable at the
API layer per #109, but are never rendered for a demo visitor). The route
first checks `vaultsLoading` (the same guard the `"/"` route already applies
below): `demoMode` starts `false` until Vault discovery's fetch resolves, so
without that guard a demo visitor opening `/settings` directly — a bookmark,
a shared link, a reload on that route — would see `SettingsPage` begin
mounting for one frame before flipping to the redirect. The sidebar footer's
own Settings link (`settingsEnabled`, passed to `app/ExplorerPane.tsx`) takes
the identical `!vaultsLoading && !demoMode` guard for the same reason: gating
on `!demoMode` alone would leave that link live and clickable for the whole
discovery fetch, not just one frame, since nothing else in the shell blocks
on `vaultsLoading` the way the `"/"` route's own content does. Everywhere a
Vault's
condition slot renders — the Scope zone, its collapsed head, the mobile
scope row/sheet (`AppTopbar.tsx`), the explorer accordion, and each graph
island caption (`GraphPage.tsx`, below) — `vaultSlotLogic.ts`'s
`deriveVaultSlot`/`deriveVaultAggregate`/`describeScopeSlot` take an optional
trailing `demoMode` parameter (default `false`) that clamps every condition
to the amber tier and swaps the Vault's own runtime message for the
instruction-free fallback sentence: nobody browsing a public demo is the one
who would act on an operator diagnostic, and the red tier's bordered ground
is reserved for something the app is not already handling. `VaultSlot`/
`VaultAggregateSlot` (`vaultSlot.tsx`) take the same optional `demoMode` prop
and thread it straight through, as does `App.tsx`'s own `describeScopeSlot`
call for the shell's scope live region. The one write-blocking use of
`deriveVaultSlot` outside a rendered slot — `NotePage.tsx`'s
`writeBlockReason` escalation (Note reading and rendering, below) — also
takes `demoMode`: the escalation banner itself still renders in demo mode
(an honest signal, same as every other Vault condition staying visible), but
never repeats the Vault's own operator-facing Git diagnostic to a visitor
who was never going to attempt the save it warns about.

**Coordination rule:** feature work may touch `App.tsx` only when the work
packet names the route, callback, shortcut, or state integration. A large prop
surface is a coordination seam, not permission to move feature behavior into
the shell.

**Validation:** the applicable `App.*.test.tsx` (including
`App.demo-mode.test.tsx`, #152), `app/ExplorerPane.test.tsx`,
`app/AppTopbar.test.tsx`, `app/vaultSlot.test.tsx`, `useVaultScope.test.ts`,
`vaults/vaultCollection.test.ts`, `useTheme.test.tsx`, storage tests, then full
frontend checks. Layout changes to
the explorer pane need a browser as well as the suite: its zone structure
depends on real cascade behavior that jsdom does not reproduce.

### Vault collection client

**Kind:** feature/shared client.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/vaults/index.ts`
- `frontend/src/vaults/vaultCollectionStore.ts`
- `frontend/src/vaults/useVaultCollection.ts`
- `frontend/src/vaults/vaultProjection.ts`

**Public contract:** `frontend/src/vaults/index.ts` is the only import path.
It exposes the collection snapshot (`vaults`, the enabled browsing list;
`allVaults`, the registry list Vault management renders; `demoMode`,
`loading`, `error`, `recovery`, `legacyMigrationRecovery`, `registryRevision`,
`revision`, `noteCounts`), `refresh`, `fetchRegistryRevision`, and the
demo-aware slot projection (`slotFor`, `describeScope`).

**Contract and responsibility:** one module owns everything about the Vault
collection that more than one surface reads (#198): the Vault list, the
per-Vault note counts from `GET /api/v1/vaults/all/stats`, the demo-mode
projection of `app/vaultSlotLogic.ts`'s slot vocabulary, and the
`/api/v1/vaults/events` `vault-collection-revision` stream that invalidates
all three. The store is a module-level singleton behind `useSyncExternalStore`,
not a provider: the first subscriber starts the one collection read and opens
the one SSE subscription the whole app shares, and the last to unmount tears
both down, so no two surfaces can disagree about the same Vault and a Vault
mutation refreshes every surface without any of them refetching. The two
inputs each call site used to decide for itself — which count source applies,
and whether demo mode applies — are decided here; a surface with its own count
for a Vault (the graph's island node count) passes it to `slotFor` as an
override. Per-surface presentation stays in the surfaces: the presentational
slot components (`app/vaultSlot.tsx`, and the aggregate the accordion and note
page render) still take `demoMode` and a note count as props. They apply a
decision rather than making one — the client is where it is made, and the shell
hands it down — so the slot vocabulary stays renderable in isolation and its
own suites keep testing it that way.

A refresh that finds nothing new keeps the previous value's identity, and a
patch that changes nothing publishes nothing. Without that, a note write — which
bumps the collection revision — would hand every consumer a fresh-but-identical
Vault array and relayout the graph. `VaultSettingsDetail` seeds its editable
drafts once per Vault but adopts every genuinely new record for display, so it
cannot describe a Vault the Settings index disagrees with.

**Consumers:** `App.tsx`, `hooks/useVaultTree.ts`,
`components/graph/GraphPage.tsx`, `components/StatsPage.tsx`,
`features/settings/VaultSettingsIndex.tsx`, and
`features/settings/vaultGitBehavior.ts`.

**Invariants:** disabled Vaults never appear in `vaults` and never participate
in `"all"`; counts are always read at `"all"` scope regardless of the browsing
scope; exactly one `/api/v1/vaults/events` subscription exists per app;
nothing outside this directory fetches `GET /api/v1/vaults` or
`GET /api/v1/vaults/all/stats`. `VaultSettingsDetail`'s
`expected_registry_revision` is deliberately not one of these: it is a
mutation-sequencing token advanced by each step's own response, seeded from
the client and then owned locally.

**Validation:** `vaults/vaultCollection.test.ts`, then the consumer suites
(`App.*.test.tsx`, `components/graph/GraphPage.test.tsx`,
`components/StatsPage.test.tsx`,
`features/settings/VaultSettingsIndex.test.tsx`), then full frontend checks.

### Frontend API, authentication, and shared wire contracts

**Kind:** infrastructure/shared contract.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/api/api.ts`
- `frontend/src/api/apiError.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/TokenPrompt.tsx`

**Shared path:** `frontend/src/types.ts`.

**Contract and responsibility:** authenticated/time-bounded fetch, unauthorized
notification, tokenized asset/download/SSE URLs, error extraction, login prompt,
and cross-capability TypeScript representations of backend payloads. A feature
may own its wire types when all consumers go through that feature's public
entry point, as Search now does.

**Consumers:** almost every data-backed frontend capability.

**Coordination rule:** `types.ts` is not owned by whichever feature needs one
new field. Contract changes must list the backend serializer and all frontend
consumers. New feature-local types should remain local unless genuinely shared.

**Invariants:** preserve bearer/header behavior and the deliberate query-token
fallback (ADR-08). Never log or render tokens.

**Validation:** API/error tests, affected feature/consumer tests, and typecheck.
`clientAuditContracts.test.ts` audits UI, PWA, and CSS source contracts; it does
not verify Rust-to-TypeScript wire compatibility.

### Startup and model setup UI

**Kind:** product capability/adapter.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/startup/StartupGate.tsx`
- `frontend/src/startup/useStartupStatus.ts`
- `frontend/src/styles/startup.css`

**Public contract:** `StartupGate` (a pure, prop-driven presentational
component — it no longer polls itself) and `useStartupStatus`, the shared
hook that polls `/api/startup-status` and owns the model-setup actions
(accept/decline Gemma, retry). Production `App.tsx` resolves Vault discovery
before enabling this polling, so broken-registry and zero-Vault workspaces
never poll or gate; it passes the resulting discovery plus startup
`status`/`retryModelSetup` to its internal `VaultWorkspace` composition and
the gate inputs to `StartupGate` (#150: the gate
shrinks to exactly the `terms_required`/first-`downloading` model step —
`hasSteppedPastGate` latches true the first time any other state is
observed and never re-arms, so a later retry-triggered `downloading` never
reopens the full-screen gate). Every other state — `scanning`, `indexing`,
`ready`, `failed`, and anything registry- or zero-Vault-related the gate
never observed in the first place — renders the ordinary workspace, which
reads the same `status` for its own surfaces: `app/ExplorerPane.tsx`'s Scope
zone slot (`StartupProgress`) and `features/search/SearchDialog.tsx`'s
work-in-flight/failed-model blocks.

**Consumed dependencies:** shared API client and theme hook.

**Coordination paths:** `App.tsx`, `app/ExplorerPane.tsx`,
`features/search/SearchDialog.tsx`, backend startup/model setup handlers and
types, and shell-wide styles.

**Validation:** `StartupGate.test.tsx`, `useStartupStatus.test.ts`,
`App.startup-auth.test.tsx`, and full frontend checks.

### Vault explorer

**Kind:** product capability.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/components/Explorer.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ChangesPanel.tsx`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useVaultTree.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/folderPaths.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/noteCandidates.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/notePath.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/vaultTrees.ts`
- `frontend/src/styles/layout-explorer.css`

**Public contract:** `useVaultTree`, explorer tree/list components, derived
folder paths, and flattened note candidates. Since #192 the tree route sends
notes without a `vault_id` — the tree they hang from carries it — so
`lib/vaultTrees.ts` stamps each note with its Vault as the response is parsed,
before `useVaultTree` merges or flattens the trees and the grouping is gone.
`WireVaultTree` is the payload shape and `VaultTree` the attributed one every
component below the hook consumes. The sidebar is three zones — a
fixed rail, a scrolling nav, a fixed footer — and `.explorer-nav` is the scroll
container the shell restores scroll position against, not the pane itself. On
desktop with more than one enabled Vault, the shell-owned Scope zone (#138,
`app/ExplorerPane.tsx`) pins a fourth zone above the rail; it shares this
file's CSS but is not part of this capability's owned React contract.
`ChangesPanel` lists notes changed on disk; it deliberately carries no unread
count, because distinguishing external changes from the user's own edits needs
backend data that does not exist yet. Recently viewed and Changed on disk both
carry the shared `VaultPrefix` provenance marker (#140) on each row when scope
is `all` and more than one Vault is enabled; a single-Vault instance renders
unchanged. `useVaultTree` also exposes `modifiedNotesPartial` and
`modifiedNotesMissingVaults` from the `/recent` read's own envelope (#141);
`ChangesPanel` never banners a partial read — a trailing warn-ink line below
the last row names only the missing Vaults, and `StateBlock tone="error"`
replaces the empty state outright when nothing is usable. The tree read's own
`partial` (`treePartial`) is deliberately left untouched: #116 rules grouped
surfaces (tree, graph, statistics) show a missing Vault as a visible missing
group, which belongs to #142/#143, not this flattened-list rule.
`useVaultTree` additionally exposes `vaultTrees` (#142): every participating
Vault's own tree, grouped rather than merged, straight off the `/tree`
read's own per-Vault array. The existing merged `tree` (via `mergeVaultTrees`)
is unchanged and still what narrowed-scope and single-Vault-instance
rendering use; `vaultTrees` exists only to feed the shell's per-Vault
accordion under `all` (`app/vaultAccordion.ts`, `app/ExplorerPane.tsx`).
`lib/notePath.ts`'s `pathToNoteIdentity` (moved out of `Explorer.tsx` to
resolve a lint rule against non-component exports from a component file) is
consumed the same way by both: `Explorer.tsx`'s own active-path folder
highlighting, and the shell's landing-Vault resolution, which needs it
synchronously off the URL rather than waiting on `activeNote`'s own content
fetch. Its `isNoteRoutePath` states the same route grammar
without decoding it, for the note-page renderer deciding whether an href in a
note body is a route the router should take.

**Consumed dependencies:** shared API/error utilities, shared wire types,
shared UI components (`components/ui.tsx`'s `VaultPrefix` and `StateBlock`),
`lib/vaultParticipants.ts`, and router links.

**Coordination paths:** `App.tsx`, `app/ExplorerPane.tsx`, `types.ts`,
`lib/stateCompare.ts`, `lib/vaultParticipants.ts`, responsive CSS, and backend
tree/recent/event endpoints.

**Validation:** folder/note-candidate/state comparison tests and affected App
navigation tests; `app/ExplorerPane.test.tsx` covers the tree and list
components in composition, including the single-active-highlight invariant.
`hooks/useVaultTree.test.ts` covers the `/recent` read's partiality at three
and eight Vaults; the rest of the hook still needs focused coverage.

### Search dialog

**Kind:** product capability; established feature boundary.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/features/search/index.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/search/types.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/search/SearchDialog.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/search/useSearch.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/search/search.css`

Feature tests:

- `frontend/src/features/search/SearchDialog.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/search/useSearch.test.ts`

**Public contract:** `frontend/src/features/search/index.ts` is the only public
TS/TSX entry point. It exposes `useSearch`, `SearchDialog`, Search wire and
selection types, and the `/api/search` payload consumed by the hook. Search CSS
is integrated separately through the `App.css` stylesheet aggregation seam.
`useSearch` takes no scope: the fetch is always `vaults/all/search`, at the
50-row ceiling `clamp_search_limit` allows, whatever the browsing scope is.
`SearchDialog` takes `vaults`/`scope` and shows the shared `VaultPrefix`
provenance marker (#140) on a result's path line whenever the visible rows
can span Vaults — the dialog's own filter on `all`, at more than one Vault —
the same multi-Vault condition Vault Explorer's lists use, read off the
filter rather than the browsing scope now that the two can differ. The path
itself elides head-first (`.result-path-text`) so the never-eliding prefix
always reads.
`useSearch` also exposes `searchPartial`/`searchMissingVaultNames` from the
search envelope (#141), rendered with the same never-a-banner rule
`ChangesPanel` uses: a trailing warn-ink line naming only the missing Vaults
below the last result, or `StateBlock tone="error"` replacing "No matching
notes" outright when nothing is usable. Ranking is unchanged either way.

`SearchDialog` also carries its own Vault filter (#144) — a lens over the
answer in front of you, never the browsing scope, per #119's rule the
component structurally cannot violate (it has no `onScopeChange` prop at
all). `useSearch` exposes the raw `searchParticipants` (feeding per-Vault
facet counts) and `searchInitialVaultFilter` (pre-fills the filter from a
tag tap via `openSearchForTag(tag, vaultId)`, cleared the moment the dialog
closes). The filter itself is local `useState` inside `SearchDialog`, not
lifted to `useSearch` — it dies for free because `App.tsx` only mounts
`<SearchDialog>` while `searchOpen` is true, so the component remounts
fresh on every open. It opens on `scope` and a tag tap overrides that, so
narrowing the sidebar decides what the reader is shown first without
deciding what was asked. Both seeds are filtered through the enabled Vaults
and fall back to `all`, because `useVaultScope` returns the stored browsing
scope without reconciling it against the collection: a Vault disabled since
it was last browsed would otherwise open the dialog filtered to a row that
does not exist. A Vault that was asked and did not answer keeps its seeded
selection but suppresses the "No results in X" line — the row's own `no
answer` and #141's partial sentence say what happened, and claiming the
Vault has no matches would be the exact lie #141 exists to prevent. Two shapes, one meaning: a `.search-facet-rail`
column beside the results on desktop (absent only at one enabled Vault),
and a `.search-field-strip` `Scope`-beside-`Mode` pair (§18's field grammar)
that replaces the desktop Mode checkbox below 920px — both rendered
unconditionally and toggled by the same CSS breakpoint `responsive.css`
already uses, so no `isMobile` prop crosses the boundary. Filtering is a
client-side `Array.filter` over the already-fetched results; no re-fetch, no
re-ranking. `buildFacetRows` has three row states, not two: a count, the
inert `no answer` condition for a Vault that was asked and did not answer,
and an empty slot for every Vault before any search has run, which keeps the
rail a selector from the moment the dialog opens rather than a column of
`0`s that means nothing yet.

`SearchDialog` also takes `startupStatus`/`onRetryModelSetup` (#150), the
shrunk startup gate's own data (`startup/useStartupStatus.ts`): while
`scanning`/`indexing`, the result area shows a work-in-flight block
carrying the same percentage the Scope zone shows, with the query input
left enabled and the topbar's search entry point never greyed; on a failed
model download it shows the reason with a "Retry setup" action instead of
the ordinary empty/error states. Both replace the normal loading/error/empty
rendering only — the facet rail and results list underneath are unaffected
(harmlessly empty, same as any other no-data state).

**Consumed dependencies:** shared API/error utilities, shared UI components
(`components/ui.tsx`'s `VaultPrefix` and `StateBlock`), the shared
`.field`/`.field-label`/`.field-input` grammar (`App.css`),
`lib/vaultParticipants.ts`, router navigation supplied by the shell,
`startup/useStartupStatus.ts`'s status shape, and backend Search.

**Coordination paths:** `App.tsx`, `App.css`, `NotePage.tsx` (tag taps hand
`openSearchForTag` this note's own Vault id), `startup/useStartupStatus.ts`,
backend search HTTP contract, and responsive CSS.

**Pilot constraint:** co-location or façade work is structure-only. It must not
change backend retrieval, ranking, cache, or MCP behavior.

**Boundary enforcement:** production TS/TSX files outside the feature must
import the directory entry point rather than its internal files; ESLint
enforces this with `no-restricted-imports`. The raw source-audit test is
explicitly exempt, and CSS aggregation remains the declared `App.css` seam.

**Validation:** the feature's `SearchDialog.test.tsx` and `useSearch.test.ts`,
`App.navigation-search.test.tsx`, and full frontend checks.

### Note reading and rendering

**Kind:** product capability.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/components/NotePage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/NotePreview.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/PdfPreview.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/RendererComponents.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/dom.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/paragraphs.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/renderers.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/sections.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/text.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/wikilinks.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/markdown.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/noteHeadings.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/noteSearch.ts`
- `frontend/src/noteEnhancements.css`
- `frontend/src/styles/note-content.css`

**Public contract:** `NotePage`, note preview/rendering behavior, safe asset and
wikilink resolution — `useResolvedWikilinks` now sends embed and PDF targets to
`resolve-batch` as `asset_targets` alongside the note's own path and rewrites
them to the resolved Vault-relative path (#158), keeping the note-relative
reading as the fallback for anything unresolved, including the first render
before the batch returns; its asset cache is keyed by note path as well as
target, because the same filename in notes at two depths can be two files — heading/search-hit navigation, Markdown transformations,
note navigation/rendering behavior, the editable-block component map produced by
`createNoteMarkdownComponents`, the paragraph marker `CalloutOrQuote` uses to
recognise its own first child, and the soft-break splitter that reconstructs one
source line per rendered line for the two unit types addressed per line.
A note link in a rendered body is a router navigation, not a browser one:
`createNoteMarkdownComponents` emits `Link` for any href on the note route
(`isNoteRoutePath` in `lib/notePath.ts` owns that grammar, shared with the
explorer's active-path highlighting) and for the archived-note branch, so
following one repaints the note pane alone instead of remounting the app and
rebuilding every Vault tree. Every other href keeps a bare anchor on purpose:
asset and PDF URLs under `/api`, in-page fragments, and external links, where
handing the click to the browser is what the click means. Following a note
link therefore no longer lets the browser resolve a `#heading` fragment, so
`NotePage` makes that jump itself, once per history entry, gated on the body
having settled onto the note the URL names and on the heading being on screen.
That last check runs on every commit rather than on a dependency list: the
order in which the note's fetch, its wikilink resolution and its render land
differs between a cold visit and a warm one, and a subset of them named as
deps makes the jump stop happening whenever the order shifts.

A TOC click, mobile heading jump, or search deep link arms `NotePage`'s
`tailArmed` state, rendered as `data-tail` on the article; `styles/note-content.css`
reads it to add trailing scroll space only for that jump, so a heading near the
end of a note can reach the top of the pane. It resets when the note changes
and otherwise stays armed for the rest of the visit, since removing the space
would clamp `scrollTop` and pull the heading back down.
`NoteProperties` (`note-page/sections.tsx`) takes an optional `vaultName`
(#140): a synthetic, non-editable leading `Vault` row, shown whenever more than
one Vault is enabled regardless of scope — an exact read is never ambiguous
about its own Vault — including when the note carries no frontmatter at all,
which is the one case the grid renders with zero real properties. A note that
fails to load renders `StateBlock tone="error"` (#141) — the documented red
heading, not the plain empty shell "Note Unavailable" used to share with
"Not Found". `NotePage` also imports `deriveVaultSlot` from the
shell-owned `app/vaultSlotLogic.ts` (#141) to detect the open note's own
Vault being git-`unavailable` with a `dirty_working_copy`/`git_content_conflict`
condition: escalation is triggered by the write attempt, not by the
condition alone, so a stopped or conflicted Vault shows `SaveState`'s
`Not saving` and a full-bleed `.write-notice` before a save is ever
attempted (autosave's own `enabled` flag is gated on the same check), while
every other non-healthy condition — or trouble in a Vault that is not the
open note's — raises nothing here. `NotePage`'s `onTagSelect` prop is
`(tag, vaultId) => void` (#144): it wraps the raw `onTagSelect={tag =>
onTagSelect(tag, vaultId)}` when calling `<NoteProperties>`, handing Search
this note's own Vault id so a tag tap pre-selects it in the dialog's filter
— tags are per-Vault vocabularies. `NoteProperties`'s own prop to
`TagChips` is untouched. `NotePage` also reads a `?restoreEdit=1` query
param (#151): held-draft recovery in Settings seeds this note's ordinary
`lib/writeDrafts.ts` draft slot, navigates here with the marker, and
`NotePage` opens the editor the same way its own Edit button would (calling
the same `startEditing`, which reads that draft), then strips the marker via
a `replace` navigation so a refresh does not reopen it. Independently, a
dismissible (per view, not persisted — it returns on every load until the
last held draft is dealt with) notice above the note body names any drafts
`lib/writeDrafts.ts`'s `listHeldDrafts` reports and links to Settings;
ordinary post-#137 per-note draft recovery is unaffected. That notice is
additionally suppressed whenever `demoMode` is true (#152), regardless of
`listHeldDrafts`: it names and links to a Settings surface withheld from a
demo visitor entirely, and a pre-#137 held draft could in principle exist in
any browser profile a demo instance happens to be served from. `NotePage`'s
`Vault` property row (`NoteProperties`'s `vaultName`, above) is a name only
— it carries no condition slot, so #152's demo-mode amber clamp on
`deriveVaultSlot` has nothing to touch there; the one other `deriveVaultSlot`
call here, `writeBlockReason`'s write-blocking Git escalation, takes an
optional `demoMode` prop (#152) for the same instruction-free-sentence clamp
(Application shell and navigation, above) — the escalation banner itself
still renders, since it stays honest about Vault trouble independent of
whether editing is offered, but never repeats the Vault's own operator
diagnostic. `handleSave`'s catch and `handleBodyDrop`'s attachment-upload
catch both take the optional `onDemoRefusal` prop (#152, Note editing and
vault actions), checked first — `handleSave` falls back to its existing
`ConflictError`/generic-error branches on a miss, `handleBodyDrop` to its
existing generic `onWriteNotice` fallback.

**Consumed dependencies:** API/auth helpers, router state, Markdown/rendering
libraries, shared types/UI, note editing (including its held-draft recovery
model, #151), and `app/vaultSlotLogic.ts`'s `deriveVaultSlot` (Application
shell and navigation).

**Coordination paths:** `App.tsx`, `types.ts`, `app/vaultSlotLogic.ts`,
note/link/resolve/download handlers, `NoteEditor.tsx`,
`features/settings/UnsavedDrafts.tsx` (the `?restoreEdit=1` contract), Search
query navigation, shared and responsive CSS.

**Invariants:** vault Markdown remains the rendered source; vault content is
data rather than trusted executable instructions; asset URLs retain auth and
path safety; **the rendered body keeps one line per source line**, since inline
editing addresses blocks by line number and a transform that collapses lines
would write to the wrong place (`linesMatch` enforces this at runtime and
disables inline editing for that note); a callout body and a wrapped list item
are rebuilt rather than passed through, so their positions do not survive and a
line's **index** is the only thing mapping it back to the file, which is why no
interior line is dropped while splitting and why a list item whose rendered line
count disagrees with the span it claims is addressed whole rather than written to
a guessed line.

**Validation:** note-page unit tests, `NotePage.test.tsx` (write/read
escalation), `NotePage.body-links.test.tsx` (in-body link routing and the
fragment jump), Markdown/heading/search/state tests,
`App.content-rendering.test.tsx`, `App.enhancements.test.tsx`,
`App.links-download.test.tsx`, and full frontend checks.

### Note editing and vault actions

**Kind:** product capability/adapter; safety-sensitive.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/api/writeApi.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/NoteEditor.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/NoteActionsDialog.tsx`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useNoteActions.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useNoteAutosave.ts`

- `frontend/src/components/note-page/conflictDiff.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/frontmatter.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/note-page/inlineEditorContext.ts`

**Public contract:** write capability discovery and operations, editor/action
components, note-action/write-mode hooks, local draft behavior, client path
validation, upload normalization, frontmatter editing, conflict display,
wikilink autocomplete, inline block editing (the editor provider/context, the
per-block wrapper, the CodeMirror block input and its markdown syntax
highlighting, click-to-write in the space between blocks, structural block
operations, document-level undo, autosave scheduling and save state), line
mapping between rendered nodes and file lines, and attachment acceptance and
insertion. `lib/writeDrafts.ts`'s `HeldDraft`/`listHeldDrafts`/
`discardHeldDraft`/`collectLegacyHeldDrafts` (#151) are the recovery model
for drafts that predate Vault qualification, consumed by Settings'
`UnsavedDrafts.tsx`; ordinary per-note and create drafts
(`saveNoteDraft`/`loadNoteDraft`/`clearNoteDraft`/`saveCreateDraft`/
`loadCreateDraft`/`clearCreateDraft`/`pruneNoteDrafts`) are unchanged.
`hooks/useNoteActions.ts`'s `openCreateDialog` takes an optional second
`targetVaultId` parameter (#151) so a caller outside the currently open note
— draft recovery — can pin which Vault a note is created in, overriding
`resolvePrimaryVaultId`'s inference for that one dialog session.

`lib/linePrefix.ts`'s `linePrefix` (#286) reads a line's whole invisible
leading run - its indentation, then any list marker, task box, heading hashes,
or quote arrows behind it - rather than only a marker and the indent ahead of
one. Indentation counts with no marker required, so a wrapped list item's
continuation line (addressed alone under D25a) reports the indent that has no
rendered counterpart. `caretMap.ts` consumes it directly; its former private
`invisiblePrefix`, which widened the answer for the caret only, is gone, and the
two no longer disagree on an indented heading or quote. `note-page/editorFont.ts`'s
`resolveFont` is the other half of making that hang land: `getComputedStyle().font`
serializes empty whenever a longhand cannot fold back into the shorthand, which
the heading fonts do through `font-variation-settings`, so the longhands are
composed instead. `BlockInput.tsx` hangs nothing for a `code block` unit, whose
leading spaces are partly rendered.

`hooks/useWriteMode.ts` needs no demo-mode branch of its own (#152):
`GET .../write-capabilities` carries the same `demo_guard` layer every
mutation route does (`src/server.rs`'s route registration, grouped with
mutations "since it is write-capability discovery, not content browsing;
gated the same as the mutations it describes"), so the request 403s with
`demo_read_only` in demo mode before the handler's own `enabled` field is
ever computed, and this hook's existing catch already resolves
`writeEnabled` to `false` — every affordance it gates (New note, Edit,
attachment drop) is already absent with no client-side clamp needed.
`writeApi.ts` exports `DEMO_READ_ONLY_CODE`/`isDemoReadOnlyError`, reading
the `code` every write error now carries (`parseError` returns `{message,
code}` rather than a bare string) so a demo refusal can be told apart from
every other write failure. `App.tsx`'s `handleDemoRefusal` is the
defense-in-depth backstop for a write that reaches the server anyway: one
app-authored sentence into the shared `.write-notice` strip (never the
server's own message, and never the generic inline failure state a note
action's dialog or the editor would otherwise show), plus a fresh
`loadVaults()` call — "the app re-asks the server what it is permitted to
do" — and no retry affordance. It is threaded into `useNoteActions.ts`'s
five write handlers through one shared `handleDemoRefusal` closure local to
that hook (checked first in each catch block via `if (handleDemoRefusal(error))
return;`; closes the action dialog on a hit rather than leaving it open —
extracted rather than repeated five times once the fifth call site made the
duplication real, not premature); into `NotePage.tsx`'s `handleSave` catch
(exits editing rather than showing `ConflictError`'s or a generic error's
inline banner); into its `handleBodyDrop` attachment-upload catch (Note
reading and rendering, above); into `NoteEditor.tsx`'s own `uploadEditorFile`
catch via a new `onDemoRefusal` prop `NotePage.tsx` passes straight through,
so a demo refusal on an in-editor attachment drop or paste clears the
editor's own inline `attachmentNotice` rather than showing it there; and into
the block-editor autosave `save` callback `useNoteAutosave` wraps (`NotePage.tsx`
sets a local `autosaveDemoRefusal` flag on a hit, rethrows so the hook still
halts autosave for the rest of this note session the same as any other
failure, and that flag suppresses only the generic "could not reach the
vault" banner the hook's own `"error"` status would otherwise show —
`SaveState`'s terse "Not saving" pill is untouched, since it names no
message and carries no instruction either way).

**Consumed dependencies:** shared API/types/UI, router navigation, vault tree
note candidates, and backend HTTP write endpoints.

**Coordination paths:** `App.tsx`, `NotePage.tsx`, `types.ts`,
`noteEnhancements.css`, `features/settings/UnsavedDrafts.tsx` (consumes the
held-draft model and `openCreateDialog`'s target-Vault override), backend
`handlers/vault_write.rs`, and `vault/write/**`.

**Invariants:** expected content hashes remain part of update concurrency;
delete stays recoverable; client validation does not replace backend path
safety; every mutation continues through backend `vault/write` (ADR-03/11);
**nothing re-serializes a note** — edits replace only the lines a block owns and
reproduce the file's own line endings; **block operations refuse rather than
guess** when a range no block owns lies between them, or when the rendered tree
is still settling behind a wikilink resolve.

**Validation:** write API (`writeApi.test.ts`, including the demo_read_only
code-carrying cases), editor, action dialog, upload, draft, path,
frontmatter, conflict, and autocomplete tests; `blockOps`, `sourceMap`,
`caretMap`, `caretPoint`, `editHistory`, `linePrefix`, `editorFont`,
`useNoteAutosave`,
`attachmentDrop`, `inlineEditing`, and `properties` tests;
`useNoteActions.test.tsx` (#152); plus `App.write-mode.test.tsx`,
`App.demo-mode.test.tsx` (#152), and full frontend checks.

### Graph

**Kind:** product capability; suitable bounded dry-run candidate.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/components/graph/GraphPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/graph/graphSimulation.ts`
- `frontend/src/styles/graph.css`

**Public contract:** `GraphPage`, graph simulation helpers (including the
island layout primitives `computeIslandCenters`, `buildIslandGraphs`, and
`createIslandSimulation` — #143), and the `/api/v1/vaults/{scope}/graph`
payload. Under `all` with more than one participating Vault, every Vault's
component is laid out on its own and placed as a labelled, dash-enclosed
island on one shared canvas (one zoom, one pan); at zero or one participating
component — including a single-enabled-Vault instance under `all` — the page
is byte-identical to the narrowed single-Vault graph (#118's resolution).

**Consumed dependencies:** shared API/error/types/UI, router navigation,
`d3-force`, `useVaultDiscovery` (Vault-management order, `demoMode`, and
per-Vault condition, reused via `deriveVaultSlot(vault, count, demoMode)` for
each island's caption so a demo instance's islands clamp to the amber tier
the same as every other Vault chrome, #152), and `describeVaultsNotDrawn`
from `lib/vaultParticipants.ts`.

**Coordination paths:** `App.tsx`, `types.ts`, backend graph wire types/handler,
`app/vaultSlotLogic.ts`, `lib/vaultParticipants.ts`, `hooks/useVaultScope.ts`,
`test/fixtures/vaults.ts`, and responsive CSS.

**Validation:** `GraphPage.test.tsx`, `graphSimulation.test.ts`, an App route
smoke test if routing changes, and full frontend checks.

### Statistics

**Kind:** product capability.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/components/StatsPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/styles/stats.css`

**Public contract:** `StatsPage` and the
`GET /api/v1/vaults/{vault_id}/stats/detail` payload (#137; the legacy
unscoped `/api/stats` this section previously cited was retired in #101).

**Consumed dependencies:** shared API/error/types/UI and router links.

**Coordination paths:** `App.tsx`, `types.ts`, backend stats wire types/handler,
and responsive CSS.

**Validation:** add focused component coverage for behavioral changes, affected
route tests, and full frontend checks.

### Settings

**Kind:** product capability/adapter.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/features/settings/SettingsPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/VaultSettingsIndex.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/VaultSettingsIndex.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/vaultGitBehavior.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/VaultCreation.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/VaultCreation.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/vaultCreation.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/UnsavedDrafts.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/UnsavedDrafts.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/relativeTime.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/settings.css`
- `frontend/src/features/settings/SettingsPage.test.tsx`

**Public contract:** the Settings page presents a two-level Vault-management index
from `GET /api/v1/vaults`, including disabled Vaults only in Settings, and each
selected Vault's condition, editable definition fields, identity facts, and
revisioned pause/rebuild/disconnect controls through the existing Vault API.

A git-backed Vault's own page (issue #149, resolving #121) carries one
segmented Git-behaviour control offering the four behaviours legal on a
folder Hatchdoor did not clone (`local`/`existing_git`: No Git, Local
history, Pull-only, Two-way) or the two legal on one it did
(`managed_git`: Pull-only, Two-way) — illegal options are absent, not
greyed. The plaque above it states the folder's source kind as a fixed
identity fact and, once the behaviour requires a remote, gains an
affordance that opens its repository, branch and folder
(`vault_subdirectory`) lines into fields; a Vault's own `repository_path`
disk location is never itself editable here. Every change that would alter
`same_source_identity` (`src/vault_registry.rs`) — crossing the No-Git/Git
boundary, or editing repository/branch/folder — runs one refuse-then-confirm
round trip: a confirmation modal, then a client-orchestrated
disable→PATCH(`confirm_identity_change: true`)→enable sequence. A failed
disable or a failed edit is rolled back by re-enabling and reporting nothing
changed; a failed final enable leaves the Vault paused with a persistent
red-line recovery state (a `hatchdoor:vault-recovery:{vaultId}`
`localStorage` marker, since the registry has no "wanted enabled but
couldn't" flag of its own) shown on both the Vault's own page and its
management entry in the index, each carrying one recovery button that
re-enables with a freshly fetched revision. Sign-in is one no-sign-in/access-
token control with no separate Remove; the token field is always empty and
its state reads `saved`, `none`, or (the instant an identity field changes)
`will be cleared`. The sync schedule is a 1–1440-minute field (client-side
bounded; the registry enforces only a 60s floor) defaulting to 1440,
shown whenever the drafted behaviour is remote-backed — this resolves #148's
outstanding AC4: the local-edit-to-commit trigger is not a configurable
debounce and does not belong to this field, which answers a different
question, how often to poll a remote for incoming changes. #267 gave that
trigger its successor without a setting: `vault_watcher.rs`'s fixed
non-configurable debounce now asks for a commit turn as well as an index
turn, so a Vault commits shortly after the writing stops. A live Git console
(shown whenever the Vault's own `git` status is not `"disabled"`) carries a
`Sync now`/`Commit now`/`Try again` button calling `POST .../sync` or
`.../retry`. Which of the first two it offers, and whether the healthy
sentence names a remote at all, comes from the Vault's `capabilities.sync`
flag rather than from its Git mode string. That flag is definition-derived,
so a failing Vault keeps its own label (#267). It
renders one of nine failure sentences off `git_error.code` (plus an
unrecognised-code fallback) — the two carrying an affected-file list
(`managed_git_dirty_working_copy`, `managed_git_conflict`) render it from
`git_error.detail`'s `affected_paths` data, not from the message string.
This page owns all of this wording itself; the server sends only codes
(matching this page's existing reindex/Git-init confirmation copy).
`vaultGitBehavior.ts` holds every pure helper above (behaviour derivation,
identity comparison, failure-code copy, the recovery marker) split out of
the component file because a file exporting non-component values breaks
Fast Refresh (`react-refresh/only-export-components`).

Switching `mode` alone (a behaviour swap that stays within
`local`/`existing_git`'s three Git modes, or `managed_git`'s two) never needs
the Vault disabled or `confirm_identity_change`, since `mode` and
`poll_interval_secs` sit outside source identity. This page also presents
server-provided setting metadata at `/settings`, keeps copy and section
layout in the browser, confirms saves that rebuild indexing, generates an MCP
token candidate without persisting it, reveals an MCP secret only when it
grants the authenticated viewer no new capability, PATCHes only the active
section's changed keys to `/api/settings` before replacing its state with the
complete response, and shows no instance-wide status console: #183 retired
the **Search index** and **Versioning** consoles, their two-second polling of
`/api/index-status` and `/api/git-status`, and the local-Git-initialisation
and remote-downgrade confirmations that went with them. Each Vault's own
settings page is where that information lives now.

When `GET /api/v1/vaults` reports `recovery` (the registry file itself is
unreadable, #150), `VaultSettingsIndex.tsx` replaces its whole `Vaults`
group with the same documented error block `App.tsx`'s note-pane shows,
omitting `Add a Vault`; `This server` is a separate group and keeps working.
`legacyMigrationRecovery` is deliberately not surfaced here — the registry
loads fine (empty) in that case, so the group renders its ordinary
zero-Vault state.

`VaultCreation.tsx`'s `VaultCreationDialog` (issue #153) is the one creation
flow both `Add a Vault` entry points open: the settings index's own button
here, and the zero-Vault workspace state's button in `App.tsx`, which has no
room for the flow itself and instead navigates to `/settings` carrying
`{state: {openVaultCreation: true}}`, consumed once by `SettingsPage.tsx` (via
`useLocation`, cleared with `navigate(..., {replace: true})` so a later
back/forward visit does not reopen it) and threaded down as
`VaultSettingsIndex`'s `autoOpenCreation` prop. The dialog collects a name,
one source configuration, and an `exclude_patterns` list (issue #157) via
`vaultGitBehavior.ts`'s shared `parseExcludePatterns` — also now used by the
edit flow's own field instead of a second inline `split(",")` normalizer —
sent in the initial `POST` (omitted when empty, relying on the server's
default, the same convention `credentials` already used) so the first
admitted Index turn observes it rather than waiting on a later edit-flow
`PATCH`. It also reuses `vaultGitBehavior.ts`'s
`behaviorOptions`/`buildSourceForBehavior`/`withIdentityFields` unchanged —
the same two-step composition the edit flow already uses, starting from an
empty `local` or `managed_git` source instead of an existing Vault's — so a
brand-new Vault's Git behaviour is chosen with the identical four-or-two-option
control the edit page presents. `vaultCreation.ts` holds the pieces specific to
creation: `baseSourceForKind`, `validateCreateSource`, and the
`POST /api/v1/vaults` call itself, fetching a fresh `expected_registry_revision`
immediately before submitting (the same pattern `recoverPausedVault` already
uses) rather than trusting a value read whenever the dialog opened. On success
the dialog calls back with the created `VaultSummary`: `VaultSettingsIndex`
appends it to its own list, calls the optional `onVaultCreated` prop (wired to
`App.tsx`'s `discovery.loadVaults`, so the sidebar/scope zone/explorer also
learn about the new Vault without a reload — the settings index's own list is
a separate fetch from that app-wide discovery), and opens the new Vault's own
page the same way clicking it in the index does. A registry-revision conflict
and every structured API failure render as a form-level notice without
clearing entered fields; a credential token is held only in the dialog's own
React state, never logged, never echoed back, and simply omitted from the
request body when no sign-in is chosen. Demo mode removes the button in both
entry points (`VaultSettingsIndex`'s own `demo_mode` read, and `App.tsx`
passing its `demoMode` down as `ZeroVaultState`'s `demoMode` prop) — belt and
suspenders alongside the invariant below, since the zero-Vault state renders
on a route demo visitors can otherwise reach.

`UnsavedDrafts.tsx` (#151) is a second "This server" nav entry, shown only
while `lib/writeDrafts.ts`'s `listHeldDrafts()` returns at least one draft
recovered from before Vault qualification (#137): a pre-#137 note draft was
keyed by slug alone, and the standalone create draft has never carried a
Vault. Each row lets the operator pick a destination Vault (pre-filled only
at exactly one enabled Vault), then Restore or Discard independently — no
batch action, since drafts need not share a Vault. Restoring a note draft
checks the destination Vault for a note at that slug before acting: found,
it seeds that Vault's ordinary `lib/writeDrafts.ts` per-note draft slot and
navigates to `NotePage` with `?restoreEdit=1`, which `NotePage.tsx` (#151)
reads once to open the editor the same way its own Edit button would, then
strips the marker; not found, the row offers a different Vault or restoring
the text as a new note (preserving the standalone create draft's own
`folder`, or an empty folder for a recovered note draft, which carries only
a slug) through `OpenCreateDraft`, a typed callback `UnsavedDrafts.tsx`
exports and `App.tsx` supplies: it seeds the standalone create draft and
calls `hooks/useNoteActions.ts`'s `openCreateDialog` with an explicit target
Vault ID (its second, optional parameter, added for this ticket) rather than
the Vault `resolvePrimaryVaultId` would otherwise infer from the currently
open note. A restored note draft keeps its own `baseContentHash` — the
version it was actually typed against — rather than the destination note's
current hash, so `NotePage.tsx`'s existing stale-draft comparison still
fires correctly. `relativeTime.ts`'s `formatWhen` (accepting either an ISO
string or an epoch-ms number) is the one relative-age ladder both this
section's draft rows and the Git/index status console share. The section is
a migration artefact, not a standing feature: it withdraws for good once the
last held draft is discarded or restored. `NotePage.tsx` separately shows a
dismissible (per view, not persisted) notice above the note body — naming
only that drafts are held and linking to this section, not repeating this
section's own explanation of what was cleared — whenever any held draft
exists; ordinary post-#137 per-note draft recovery (returning to a note and
clicking Edit) is unchanged. The one-time sweep that populates held drafts
(`collectLegacyHeldDrafts`) and the one-time removal of note- or
folder-naming browser state it cannot trust across Vault qualification
(`lib/storage.ts`'s `clearLegacyNoteScopedBrowserState` — Recent notes, the
last note opened, unfolded explorer folders, explorer scroll position; six
Vault-agnostic preferences are left untouched) both run once, synchronously,
in `main.tsx` before the app ever renders, so every component's first read
already reflects them.

Out of this page's scope: giving a Vault a source it did not start with (its
first repository, i.e. a Local Vault becoming `managed_git`, or a bare
first-run Vault) is the separate first-run flow (#122), not a field this page
edits. `docs/design/design-system.html` is not documented against this
ticket's primitives — on this branch it predates even #120's Settings work
and has diverged from `development`'s own (also incomplete) copy; treated as
separate, pre-existing design-system documentation debt rather than in scope
here.

**Consumed dependencies:** authenticated `apiFetch`, the settings HTTP
contract, and (for `UnsavedDrafts.tsx`) `lib/writeDrafts.ts`'s held-draft
functions.

**Coordination paths:** `frontend/src/App.tsx` (route; also supplies
`vaults` and `onOpenCreateDraft` to `SettingsPage`, and seeds the standalone
create draft before opening the dialog), `frontend/src/app/ExplorerPane.tsx`
(normal-deployment navigation), `frontend/src/App.css` (stylesheet
aggregation), `frontend/src/components/NotePage.tsx` (`?restoreEdit=1`
handling and the held-drafts notice), `frontend/src/hooks/useNoteActions.ts`
(`openCreateDialog`'s target-Vault override), `frontend/src/main.tsx` (runs
the one-time legacy sweep and browser-state cleanup before rendering),
`src/server.rs` (SPA/API routes), `src/handlers/settings.rs` (settings wire
producer), and `frontend/src/types.ts`
(`VaultSource`/`VaultGitMode`, mirroring `src/vault_registry.rs`'s
same-named types, and `VaultSummary`'s `source` field, now typed rather than
`unknown`; consumed by this section and by
`frontend/src/app/vaultSlotLogic.ts`, already listed under Vault chrome's
own `types.ts` coordination entry).

**Invariants:** demo mode exposes no Settings navigation or endpoints;
environment-managed and permanently unavailable values are records rather than
disabled form controls; secret values are never rendered from the settings
document; a held draft is deleted only through an explicit Restore or
Discard, never aged out.

**Validation:** `SettingsPage.test.tsx`, `VaultSettingsIndex.test.tsx`,
`VaultCreation.test.tsx`, `UnsavedDrafts.test.tsx`, affected shell tests
(`App.startup-workspace-states.test.tsx` covers the zero-Vault entry point),
frontend typecheck, then full frontend checks.

### Shared UI and styling

**Kind:** shared infrastructure.

**Owned paths:** none by default.

**Paths:**

- `frontend/src/components/ui.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/icons.tsx`
- `frontend/src/index.css`
- `frontend/src/App.css`
- `frontend/src/styles/base.css`
- `frontend/src/styles/topbar.css`
- `frontend/src/styles/ui-common.css`
- `frontend/src/styles/responsive.css`

**Contract and responsibility:** shared primitives, global tokens/base rules,
style aggregation, topbar/shell styles, and cross-feature responsive overrides.
The tokens in `base.css` are governed by
[`docs/design/design-system.html`](../design/design-system.html), which is
authoritative for visual decisions across every feature stylesheet; a component
the system does not yet cover gets its section added by the change that ships
it. `icons.tsx` holds the inlined Material Symbols (Sharp) set; icons size to
`1em` and paint with `currentColor`, so callers control them through font-size
and color. Attribution lives in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. `VaultPrefix` (#140) is
the one marked-path-root primitive every flattened, scope-spanning surface
uses for Vault provenance — hot ink, a middot instead of a folder `/`, and
never eliding; consumers give the adjacent title or path the shrinking room
instead. `StateBlock` (`ui.tsx`) takes an optional `tone="error"` (#141) for
the documented §23 red-heading variant — a genuine failure, never the plain
empty shell — consumed wherever a partial collection read has nothing usable
and wherever an exact read fails outright.

**Coordination rule:** a feature work packet should prefer its owned stylesheet.
Changes to shared selectors, tokens, or responsive rules must name affected
features. `App.css` remains an aggregation/composition stylesheet; feature
styles should migrate only as part of a declared boundary pilot.

**Validation:** affected component/App tests, responsive manual or screenshot
review when layout changes, `python3 docs/design/palette.py` when a `base.css`
accent or token changes, and full frontend checks.

### Small shared browser utilities

**Kind:** shared infrastructure.

**Owned paths:**

- `frontend/src/lib/clipboard.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/stateCompare.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/vaultParticipants.ts`

**Consumers:** shell copy actions and rendered code-block controls consume
clipboard behavior. Vault Explorer consumes tree comparison, while Note reading
consumes note and link comparison. `vaultParticipants.ts` (#141) — a
`VaultReadProjection`'s `participants` down to the Vaults that did not answer
fresh, and the shared "X did not answer." sentence — is consumed by Vault
Explorer (`ChangesPanel`) and Search (`SearchDialog`), the two flattened
collection surfaces a `partial` read can span.

**Coordination rule:** keep these utilities behavior-only. Feature-specific
copy labels, workflows, or state ownership stay with their feature.

**Validation:** `clipboard.test.ts` and `stateCompare.test.ts`.

### Frontend test infrastructure

**Kind:** test infrastructure, not production ownership.

**Paths:**

- `frontend/src/test/setup.ts`
- `frontend/src/test/fixtures/vaults.ts`
- all `frontend/src/**/*.test.ts`
- all `frontend/src/**/*.test.tsx`

Tests follow the production boundary they cover. Cross-feature `App.*` tests
belong to composition and must be run when their named integration changes.
`test/fixtures/vaults.ts` (#137) is the shared multi-Vault fixture set every
later slice's tests assert against: one, three, and eight Vaults, and a
builder for each non-healthy per-Vault condition (indexing, stale, sync
failed, sync stopped, conflict, unavailable) plus the collection-read
envelope/participant shapes.

## Auxiliary repository paths

These paths are outside the runtime module catalog and require separate work
packet scope:

- `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`: packaging/deployment. The Dockerfile's
  default target produces the rootless runtime image; `verification` runs the
  default-feature locked Rust suite. BuildKit Cargo cache mounts and optional
  Cargo build controls are documented in `docs/development/container-builds.md`.
  Consumers are local Docker builders and external CI; no provider-specific
  configuration belongs in this contract. Validate cold/warm verification,
  source/dependency invalidation, and the final image's platform/healthcheck.
- `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain.toml`: Rust build and dependency
  coordination.
- `frontend/package.json`, lockfile, TypeScript/Vite/ESLint configuration:
  frontend build and dependency coordination.
- `assets/**`: project branding and screenshots.
- `docs/**`: user, contributor, architecture, research, and roadmap

## Full validation gates

Backend:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Use focused tests during development. Run the full gates before merging a
boundary or interface change.
