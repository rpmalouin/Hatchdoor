# How to set up a Git-backed Vault

This covers adding or editing a Vault's Git behaviour from the Web UI's **Settings** screen — not the MCP/API path, which [[How to deploy Hatchdoor with an agent]] and [[HTTP API reference]] already cover. If you only want a plain folder with no Git at all, [[Connect your first Vault]] is the shorter path.

## Pick the right starting point first

Three questions decide which option you want, before you open the form:

- **Does this Vault need version history or a remote at all?** If not, choose **A folder on this server** and leave its Git behaviour at **No Git** — a plain folder, nothing else.
- **Do you already keep this folder in Git yourself, on the same machine Hatchdoor runs on?** Choose **A folder on this server**, then pick a Git behaviour (**Local history**, **Pull-only**, or **Two-way**) — Hatchdoor uses your existing working copy in place. It never clones it.
- **Is the source of truth a remote repository you don't have checked out locally?** Choose **A managed Git checkout** — Hatchdoor clones the repository itself and owns that checkout.

## Create the Vault

Open **Settings** → **Add a Vault**, then:

1. Enter a **Name**.
2. Optionally fill **Ignore these files and folders** with comma-separated patterns to leave out of this Vault's search.
3. Under **Where is this Vault?**, choose **A folder on this server** or **A managed Git checkout**.
4. If you chose **A folder on this server**, enter its **Folder path** — the path as the Hatchdoor container sees it, not your host machine's path (see [[Connect your first Vault]] if that distinction is new).
5. Under **Git behaviour**, choose one of the options below. A managed checkout only offers **Pull-only** and **Two-way** — a managed Vault exists specifically to track a remote, so there's no "no remote" option for it.
6. If the behaviour you chose talks to a remote, fill in the fields that appear: **Repository URL**, optionally **Branch** and **Folder within the repository**, **Sign-in**, and the **Sync schedule**.
7. Select **Create Vault**.

## The four Git behaviours

| Behaviour | What it does | Available on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No Git** | Nothing — a plain folder, no history, no remote. | A folder on this server |
| **Local history** | Hatchdoor commits your changes locally, shortly after you stop writing. Never contacts a remote. | A folder on this server |
| **Pull-only** | Fetches from the remote on the sync schedule and sends nothing back. The Vault refuses every write, so Hatchdoor never commits on it. | Either |
| **Two-way** | Commits your changes locally, and fetches from and pushes to the remote on the sync schedule. | Either |

Hatchdoor commits a few seconds after the writing stops, so one commit usually gathers a burst of changes rather than one save. Sending those commits to a remote is separate and still happens on the sync schedule, so on Two-way your history is current locally long before the remote sees it. The subject names the first few writes it recorded and how many files they touched, and the body carries whatever one-line summary each of those writes supplied. An agent connected over MCP can pass a summary on every write, which is what turns the history into an answer to "why did this note change?". Edits you make in the Vault folder yourself carry no summary, so a commit made up only of those keeps the generic `hatchdoor: vault update`.

> [!warning]
> Local history creates a hidden `.git` folder inside the Vault's own notes folder to hold its history, and that folder grows permanently: every image and PDF ever attached stays in it, even after you delete the file from the Vault. Don't reach for Local history on a Vault with large attachments unless you're prepared for that growth.

## The shared remote fields

These appear whenever the chosen behaviour talks to a remote (**Pull-only** or **Two-way**, on either source):

- **Repository URL** — required for Pull-only/Two-way; not shown for Local history, which has nothing to fetch or push.
- **Branch** (optional) — leave blank to track the remote's default branch.
- **Folder within the repository** (optional) — leave blank to use the repository root as the Vault.
- **Sign-in** — **No sign-in** for a public repository, or **Access token** for a private one. The token is HTTPS-only, write-only (never shown again once saved), and stored separately from every other credential Hatchdoor holds.
- **Sync schedule** — how often Hatchdoor checks the remote absent a manual sync, since "Hatchdoor has no way to be told when something is pushed." Anywhere from 1 minute to 1440 minutes (24 hours); the default is the slowest setting, once a day, so a Vault you want to stay current sooner needs a shorter interval set deliberately.

The schedule is measured from the Vault's last completed check and survives a restart: Hatchdoor remembers when each Vault last checked, so restarting or redeploying resumes the countdown instead of starting a fresh one. A Vault that is already past its interval when Hatchdoor starts syncs straight away, and one still inside its interval waits out the remainder rather than checking again. This matters on a deployment that redeploys often — before, a Vault set to check once a day would sync on every restart and never actually reach a scheduled check.

Changing the schedule applies to the check the Vault is already waiting on, not just the one after it: shorten a Vault from daily to hourly and its next check moves to an hour after its last one, which may be immediately. Lengthening the schedule leaves the pending check where it is and takes effect from there on, so a Vault never has a check it was about to make pushed further away.

The exception is a Vault that is currently retrying a failure. After a check fails for a reason worth retrying — a remote that was briefly unreachable — Hatchdoor schedules the retry itself, in seconds rather than on your schedule, and shortening the interval deliberately leaves that retry alone rather than making a failing remote be hammered harder. So if you shorten the schedule of a Vault showing `unavailable` and its next check does not move, that is the retry in progress, not the edit being ignored; the new schedule takes over once a check succeeds.

## Editing an existing Vault's Git settings

Open the Vault from **Settings** and its own page has a **Save Vault** button in the header, plus a **Sync** console (when Git applies) showing whether the last sync was healthy and a **Sync now** (or **Try again**, if something failed) button.

Two kinds of edit behave differently:

- **Ordinary edits** — name, ignored patterns, archive folder, commit identity, sync schedule, or switching between Pull-only and Two-way on the *same* repository — save immediately with **Save Vault**.
- **Identity changes** — a different folder path, repository URL, branch, or subdirectory — change what the Vault actually points at. For a local folder these fields are always editable directly; for a Git-sourced Vault they're read-only until you select **Edit** to unlock them. Saving one of these shows a confirmation first:

> [!note]
> "This runs as one step: the Vault pauses, the change saves, and the Vault starts back up. It stays out of the sidebar and All Vaults for that moment." Confirming also clears any stored sign-in token, even if you didn't touch it — sign in again afterward if the Vault still needs one. If you're moving into Local history, the disk-growth warning above appears again in the same confirmation.

If the final restart step ever fails, the Vault is left paused and hidden rather than silently broken — a banner appears with a **Try to bring this Vault back** button to retry just that step.

## If a commit or a sync fails

Every Git-backed Vault has a console on its Settings page. On a Vault with a remote it is headed **Sync** and its button reads **Sync now**; on a Local history Vault it is headed **History** and reads **Commit now**, because there is nothing to sync with. Either way it reports what happened in plain language rather than a code: a rejected sign-in, an unreachable remote, local edits Hatchdoor isn't sure how to reconcile, or unpushed commits sitting on a Pull-only Vault it isn't allowed to push. Every failure sentence says what happened, confirms nothing was lost, and states the one thing that clears it, ending in **Try again**.

After a failed commit Hatchdoor waits five minutes before trying again on its own, however much you write meanwhile, so a standing problem doesn't fill the log with the same error. Fix the cause and it resumes by itself; press **Commit now** or **Try again** if you don't want to wait.
