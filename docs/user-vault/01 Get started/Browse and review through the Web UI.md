# Browse and review through the Web UI

The Web UI and your agent work on the same Vault. Use the browser to inspect
the agent's change and to navigate notes visually.

1. Open `http://localhost:42824` and enter the web token if prompted.
2. Use the sidebar explorer to open the note the agent changed.
3. Find the added bullet and confirm it belongs under the intended heading.
4. Use the Vault selector to narrow to one Vault, or choose **All Vaults** to
   browse across enabled Vaults.

Narrowing to one Vault while you are reading a note takes you with it: the
note you last had open in that Vault comes back, the same way reopening
Hatchdoor returns you to the note you left. Pick a Vault you have not read
anything in yet and you land on the empty start page instead, with that
Vault's notes in the explorer. Choosing **All Vaults**, or switching while you
are in Settings, Statistics or the graph, leaves the page you are on alone.

To find notes yourself, select **Search** in the top bar (or press `/` outside
a text field). Semantic search is the default: use it for ideas and meaning.
Turn on **Keyword mode** when exact wording matters, such as a hostname, tag,
filename, command, or ID.

Search always looks in every enabled Vault, whichever one the Vault selector
is narrowed to. The list down the left of the search panel says how many
matching notes each Vault holds, and starts on the Vault you were browsing.
Select another Vault to read its matches, or **All results** to see them
together. On a phone the same choice is the **Scope** field under the search
box.

> Browser search and agent search complement each other. Search in the Web UI when you want to scan results; ask the agent when you want a controlled research or editing workflow.

The UI can also edit notes when the Vault is writable. **New note** creates a
Markdown file; click any paragraph, heading, list item, or table row to edit
it in place — see [[How to edit notes with the live editor]] for the full
rundown. If those controls are absent, the Vault is read-only or the
deployment is in demo mode.

Hatchdoor understands wikilinks and refreshes its index when Markdown or
attachments change. Keep the Markdown files portable: you can still open them
in another Markdown app at any time.
