# MCP tools reference

Every tool Hatchdoor's MCP endpoint (`/mcp`) advertises, once [[Connect your agent|MCP is connected]]. This is a lookup reference, not a tutorial — for the first read-only connection, start with [[Connect your agent]].

## Permission model

Two independent gates decide what a call can do:

- **`HATCHDOOR_MCP_ENABLED`** — MCP as a whole. Off by default. A disabled instance answers no MCP calls at all.
- **`HATCHDOOR_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED`** — write tools specifically. Off by default even when MCP is on. A write tool called while this is off returns the JSON-RPC error `MCP write tools are disabled by HATCHDOOR_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED`.

A third, per-Vault gate sits underneath write mode: a Vault's own `capabilities.mutate` (from its source type and lifecycle phase — a `pull_only` Git Vault, or one not yet `ready`, refuses writes even with `HATCHDOOR_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED=true`). Check `list_vaults` for a Vault's current capabilities before writing to it.

> [!note]
> The full tool catalogue is always advertised, even before the model-setup completes and even at zero Vaults, so a client that caches tools at connection time never needs to reconnect. Before setup finishes, only `get_model_setup_status`, `accept_gemma_terms`, `decline_gemma_terms`, and the Vault collection discovery/management tools (`list_vaults` and friends) actually run; every other tool returns "Hatchdoor is still being set up." until a model is selected. `refresh_vault` is the one management tool outside that exception: the index turn it asks for cannot run without a search model, so before setup finishes it answers like any other content tool.

There is no selected, sole, or default Vault. Every tool below that touches content takes an explicit `vault_id`; every collection-level tool takes an explicit `scope` (a Vault ID or the literal `all`).

## Model setup

Always available, regardless of `HATCHDOOR_MCP_ENABLED`'s write posture — these are the only tools that run before first-run setup completes.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get_model_setup_status` | Report setup state, the Gemma terms/policy links, and the Nomic fallback notice. No parameters. |
| `accept_gemma_terms` | Accept Gemma's terms, then download it and begin indexing. No parameters. |
| `decline_gemma_terms` | Decline Gemma, remove any partial Gemma download, download Nomic Embed Text v1.5 instead, and begin indexing. No parameters. |

> [!warning]
> Once a model is selected, calling either `accept_gemma_terms` or `decline_gemma_terms` again returns an error — changing models after setup is not supported.

## Vault collection: discovery and management

`list_vaults` is always available. The other eight require `HATCHDOOR_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED`; without it they return the same "MCP write tools are disabled" error as content write tools.

A listed Vault with a remote to poll also carries two RFC 3339 UTC timestamps describing its Git schedule: `last_checked_at`, when Hatchdoor last tried to check the remote — whether that check succeeded or failed, so read it alongside the Vault's Git status rather than as a successful sync — and `next_attempt_at`, when the next scheduled check is due. `last_checked_at` is absent until the first check completes; both are absent for a Vault with no remote and in demo mode. They are described in full under **Git schedule fields on a listed Vault** in [[HTTP API reference]], whose Vault shape `list_vaults` returns verbatim.

| Tool | Gating | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_vaults` | Always | Every Vault's ID, name, status, redacted source, capabilities, and Git schedule, plus the registry's `registry_revision`. Call this first — every write below needs a fresh `expected_registry_revision`. |
| `create_vault` | Write mode | Create a Vault definition. The registry assigns the Vault ID; read it back from `list_vaults`. |
| `edit_vault` | Write mode | Replace one Vault definition wholesale (not a patch — send back every field you want to keep). |
| `enable_vault` | Write mode | Enable a disabled Vault definition. |
| `disable_vault` | Write mode | Disable a Vault without deleting its files. |
| `disconnect_vault` | Write mode | Remove a Vault from the registry without deleting local files, checkouts, Git history, or credentials outside the registry record. |
| `sync_vault` | Write mode | Request one Vault's Git work now: a remote sync if it has a remote, a local commit if it only keeps history. |
| `retry_vault` | Write mode | Retry that same operation for one eligible Vault. |
| `refresh_vault` | Write mode | Request one Vault's next index turn, so the snapshot the collection reads project from is rebuilt from its Markdown. |

### `create_vault`

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `expected_registry_revision` | Yes | Most recent `registry_revision` from `list_vaults`. A stale value rejects the create rather than racing another writer. |
| `name` | Yes | |
| `enabled` | No | Default `true`. |
| `source` | Yes | See [[#Vault source shapes]]. |
| `exclude_patterns` | No | Glob patterns, in gitignore syntax, this Vault's index ignores. Default `[]`. |
| `https_credentials` | No | `{ "username"?: string, "token": string }`. Write-only — never echoed back; `list_vaults` reports only whether one is configured. |
| `archive_folder` | No | Per-Vault override of the instance-wide archive folder used by `archive_note`. Absent inherits the instance default. |
| `commit_identity` | No | `{ "name": string, "email": string }`. Per-Vault override of the instance-wide Git author identity. Absent inherits the instance default. |

### `edit_vault`

Same fields as `create_vault`, plus `vault_id` (the Vault to edit) in place of `enabled`. This is a **wholesale replace**, not a patch: read the Vault from `list_vaults`, change what you mean to change, and send the rest back unchanged. Leaving `exclude_patterns`, `archive_folder`, or `commit_identity` absent *clears* the stored value rather than preserving it.

`https_credentials` is the one exception — it takes a three-state action instead of a plain value, so a stored secret never has to be resent just to survive an edit:

| `action` | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `keep` | Leave the stored credential untouched. Default if the field is omitted. |
| `remove` | Delete the stored credential — a remote that needs auth will then fail to sync. |
| `replace` | Set a new `{ "username"?, "token" }`. |

> [!warning]
> Changing a Vault's `source` path, repository URL, branch, or subdirectory is an **identity change** — it repoints the Vault at different content. It is refused unless `confirm_identity_change: true` **and** the Vault is already disabled (`disable_vault` first); an identity change on an enabled Vault is refused regardless of the confirm flag. Changing `mode`, `poll_interval_secs`, `name`, credentials, exclusions, archive folder, or commit identity is not an identity change and needs neither.

### `enable_vault` / `disable_vault` / `disconnect_vault`

All three take just `vault_id` and `expected_registry_revision`.

### `sync_vault` / `retry_vault`

Both take just `vault_id`. On a Vault with a remote, `sync_vault` requests an immediate poll instead of waiting for `poll_interval_secs`, and `retry_vault` retries an operation the scheduler admitted but that failed (say a transient network error), rather than waiting for its own backoff.

On a Vault with no remote but with Git history (an `existing_git` Vault in `local_history` mode), both request an immediate local commit instead. No remote is contacted, and asking explicitly also lifts the five-minute pause that follows a failed commit. Only a Vault with no Git at all (a plain `local` source) is refused, with `capability_unavailable`. For rebuilding the search index of any Vault, Git-backed or not, use `refresh_vault`.

### `refresh_vault`

Takes just `vault_id`. It asks Hatchdoor to re-scan that Vault's Markdown and republish the snapshot the collection reads: the one `get_tree`, `get_graph`, `get_stats`, `recently_modified` and `search_notes` project from. It contacts no Git remote, and unlike `sync_vault` it works on a Vault with no Git at all.

**Call it when a collection read reports itself stale.** Those reads carry `partial` and a `participants` list (see [[#Read-only content tools]] below). A Vault whose entry reads `stale` is answering from a snapshot known to be behind its files; `refresh_vault` is how an agent asks for that to be fixed instead of waiting and hoping.

It returns as soon as the turn is admitted, not when the turn finishes:

| `schedule` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `queued` | The Vault's next index turn was admitted. |
| `coalesced` | An index turn for this Vault was already pending; this request joined it rather than queueing a second one. |

So the response tells you the request landed, not that the index is rebuilt. To see the outcome, re-read a collection read and check its freshness fields again.

A Vault that is not currently browsable — its `capabilities.browse` is false, which covers a missing or unreadable directory and a Vault whose runtime has not come up — is refused with `capability_unavailable`, marked retryable because the Vault may become browsable again.

> [!note]
> `refresh_vault` rebuilds the read model from the Markdown that is on disk. It does not repair a Vault whose index turn is failing for its own reasons: a turn that fails deterministically will fail the same way again.

## Vault source shapes

`source` on `create_vault`/`edit_vault` is tagged on `type`; each shape rejects unknown fields (`additionalProperties: false`), so a guessed field name fails loudly rather than being silently ignored.

**`local`** — a plain directory on this machine. Hatchdoor never runs Git for it.

```json
{ "type": "local", "path": "/data/vault" }
```

**`existing_git`** — a Git working copy that already exists on this machine; Hatchdoor uses it in place and never clones it.

```json
{
  "type": "existing_git",
  "repository_path": "/data/vault",
  "repository_url": "https://example.com/notes.git",
  "branch": null,
  "vault_subdirectory": null,
  "mode": "pull_only",
  "poll_interval_secs": 900
}
```

`mode` is one of `local_history` (commits locally, never contacts a remote), `pull_only` (also fetches), or `two_way` (also pushes). `repository_url` is required for `pull_only`/`two_way`; it may be `null` only for `local_history`.

**`managed_git`** — a remote repository Hatchdoor clones and owns the checkout of. No `local_history` mode — a managed Vault exists specifically to track a remote.

```json
{
  "type": "managed_git",
  "repository_url": "https://example.com/notes.git",
  "branch": "main",
  "vault_subdirectory": "notes",
  "mode": "pull_only",
  "poll_interval_secs": 900
}
```

`mode` is `pull_only` or `two_way`. `repository_url` must be a credential-free HTTPS URL — embedded credentials are rejected; supply a token through `https_credentials` instead.

`branch` and `vault_subdirectory` are `null`/absent-able on every Git shape: `null` tracks the remote's default branch, or uses the repository root, respectively. `poll_interval_secs` has a floor of `60` and defaults to `86400`; it is ignored for `local_history`, which has no remote to poll.

## Read-only content tools

Available whenever MCP is enabled, independent of write mode.

| Tool | Required parameters | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search_notes` | `scope`, `query` | Search one Vault or all enabled Vaults. Optional: `mode` (`semantic` default or `keyword`), `limit` (1–50, default 10), `per_note_cap` (1–10, default 2), `layers` (array of layer names to include). |
| `get_note` | `vault_id`, `slug` | Read one exact note's authoritative Markdown. |
| `get_note_links` | `vault_id`, `slug` | Outgoing links and backlinks for one exact note. |
| `resolve_wikilink` | `vault_id`, `target` | Resolve a wikilink target within one Vault. |
| `get_tree` | `scope` | Grouped explorer tree for one Vault or all enabled Vaults. Optional: `folder` (a Vault-relative folder to return as the root), `max_depth` (how far below it to descend, minimum 1), `include_notes` (default `true`). |
| `get_stats` | `scope` | Grouped statistics for one Vault or all enabled Vaults. Also reports `hatchdoor_version`, the running instance's version string. |
| `get_graph` | `scope` | Grouped link graph for one Vault or all enabled Vaults. |
| `get_frontmatter` | `vault_id`, `slug` | Read one exact note's frontmatter metadata — `tags`, `aliases`, and every remaining top-level key under `properties` — without returning the Markdown body. A note with no frontmatter block answers `has_frontmatter: false` with empty collections rather than an error. It also returns the note's `content_hash` — the same string `get_note` reports for that note at that instant, and covering the whole file, so a note with no frontmatter block still has one — which means the metadata can be written straight back without pulling the body over the wire first. |
| `recently_modified` | `scope` | Recently modified notes. Optional `limit` (1–25, default 5). |
| `query_notes` | `scope`, `conditions` | Select the notes whose tags, path, or frontmatter properties satisfy stated conditions. Optional: `properties` (names to return on each row), `limit` (1–200, default 50). See [[#Selecting notes by tag, path or property]]. |
| `list_note_attachments` | `vault_id`, `slug` | List the attachments one note references, without the note's full content. Every non-Markdown file the note points at counts, not only the ones Hatchdoor can display. |
| `get_attachment` | `vault_id`, `relative_path` | Fetch one attachment's bytes, addressed by the same `relative_path` `list_note_attachments` reports. Fetchable types are narrower than the managed set — `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `webp`, `svg`, `avif`, `bmp`, `pdf` — so a video or data file is listed but refused here. Optional `encoding`: `url` (the default) returns a `download_url`, `base64` returns the bytes inline. |
| `get_attachment_import_config` | `vault_id` | Report whether uploads are currently possible for this Vault, the available methods, their byte limits, and the allowed file extensions. Call this before uploading. |

Collection-scoped results (`search_notes`, `get_tree`, `get_stats`, `get_graph`, `recently_modified`, `query_notes` with `scope: "all"`) carry `scope`, `collection_revision`, `partial`, and `participants` — an agent should branch on the structured error `code`, never on message text, and should treat `partial: true` as "not every enabled Vault contributed to this result," not as an error. A Vault can sit out for more than one reason — its snapshot was not readable, or, on `get_tree`, it simply does not have the folder that was asked for — so read the reason off that Vault's entry in `participants` rather than inferring it from `partial` alone. A Vault whose entry reads `stale` is a case an agent can act on rather than only report: its snapshot is known to be behind its Markdown, and `refresh_vault`, under [[#Vault collection: discovery and management]], asks for the index turn that republishes it.

`get_tree` with nothing but `scope` returns the whole Vault, which on a few hundred notes is large enough to overflow a client's per-result budget. Three optional arguments narrow it. `include_notes: false` is the cheap one to open with: it returns every folder at every level with its note count and no notes at all, so a several-hundred-note Vault's shape costs on the order of a kilobyte instead of seventy. `folder` returns one subtree — `"40-reference/Parenting"`, matched case-insensitively, surrounding slashes ignored. `max_depth` stops the descent: the starting folder is depth 0, a folder at the limit is listed with its count but not opened, and one that had something inside it is marked `truncated` so it cannot be mistaken for an empty leaf. Every folder reports `note_count`, the notes held directly inside it, not counting its subfolders; a subtree total is the sum of those. A `folder` naming something the Vault does not have answers the structured error `folder_not_found` rather than an empty tree, so a typo never reads as an empty folder. With `scope: "all"` that refusal is per-Vault: the Vaults that do have the folder still answer, each Vault that does not appears in `participants` carrying `folder_not_found`, and the result is marked `partial`. Only when no Vault has it does the whole call refuse, and that refusal names no Vault, because none of them is more at fault than the others; the per-Vault refusals stay on `participants`, where each one does name its own Vault.

Notes inside a tree carry `title` and `slug` but no `vault_id`: the tree they sit in already names its Vault, once. Flat results that mix Vaults in a single list — `search_notes`, `recently_modified`, `query_notes` — still qualify every hit.

### Selecting notes by tag, path or property

`query_notes` answers the requests that a note's tags, folder or properties decide on their own. Every note tagged `project/active`. Everything under `40-reference`. Notes whose `review-date` has passed. It is not a search: a note either satisfies the conditions or it does not, the results are unranked and come back in the same order every time, and no embedding is involved, so a Vault that is still being indexed answers in full. Reach for `search_notes` when the question is about what a note *says*, and this when it is about what a note *is*.

`conditions` is a list, and every one of them must hold for a note to be selected. There is no whole-Vault query: at least one condition is required, and `get_tree` or `recently_modified` is the tool for reading a Vault without selecting. Three kinds:

- `{"type": "tag", "tag": "project/active"}` — the leading `#` is optional, case does not matter, and nested tags come along: `project` selects `project` and `project/active`, never `projects`.
- `{"type": "path_prefix", "prefix": "40-reference/Parenting"}` — a Vault-relative folder, matched case-insensitively and by whole path segment, so `notes` never selects `notes-archive`.
- `{"type": "property", "name": "review-date", "operator": "lt", "value": "2026-09-06"}` — one frontmatter property, tested by one operator.

The property name is matched exactly, capitalisation included. `tags` and `aliases` are refused as property names rather than quietly answering "missing" for every note: Hatchdoor parses both out of the frontmatter into their own lists, so select tags with a tag condition instead. Both can still be *returned* by naming them in `properties`.

One more difference from search: `query_notes` reads every [[The layer system|layer]] and takes no `layers` argument, so a demoted note it selects is one an ordinary search would not have returned. That matches the explorer and `get_tree` rather than `search_notes` — demotion moves a note off the default *search* surface, and a query is not a search.

Ten operators. `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt` and `gte` each need a `value`; `exists`, `missing`, `empty` and `not_empty` must not carry one. The rules worth knowing before you rely on them:

- Only `missing` selects a note that never mentions the property. `ne` does not: a note with no `status` does not have a status different from `draft`.
- `eq` against a multi-value property matches when any entry equals the value, so `for: [reference, archive]` is equal to `reference`.
- Ordered comparison works between two numbers, two strings, or two booleans, and selects nothing across types rather than guessing. Strings compare byte by byte, which orders ISO-8601 dates and timestamps correctly — that is what makes "before today" work, with today's date passed as the value.
- `empty` means present but holding nothing: bare `status:`, a blank string, an empty list, an empty mapping. A note that has no `status` line at all is `missing`, not `empty`.

`properties` names the frontmatter to return on each row. A name a note does not carry is left off that row rather than returned as null, so "no value" and "the value is null" stay apart. Rows are ordered by path, then Vault, then slug, and `limit` is applied to that order across the whole collection, so two identical calls return identical rows. When more notes qualified than `limit` allowed through, the result says `truncated: true` rather than leaving a full page to read as a complete answer.

A query Hatchdoor cannot answer — no conditions, a comparison with no value, an operator handed one it does not take — is refused with the structured error `invalid_query` naming what is wrong, before any Vault is touched.

> [!note]
> `get_attachment_import_config`'s `enabled` field is the AND of two independent gates: `HATCHDOOR_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED` (instance-wide) and the target Vault's own `capabilities.mutate` (source mode and lifecycle phase). The response explains which one is currently false when `enabled` is `false`.

`get_attachment` mirrors the inbound upload flow in the opposite direction, and its two encodings carry the same tradeoff. `encoding: "url"` returns `content.download_url` — a **relative** path to resolve against the same scheme, host, and port as the MCP endpoint itself — plus `path_note` and `auth` fields restating that. Send your MCP bearer token as an `Authorization: Bearer` header and it works: the asset route accepts that credential for as long as MCP is enabled, exactly as the upload endpoint accepts it on the way in. The web bearer token works too, as a header or an `access_token` query parameter, and with neither token configured (or in demo mode) the URL needs no credential at all. A client that cannot make an out-of-band HTTP request calls `get_attachment` again with `encoding: "base64"` and gets `content.content` inline instead — bounded by the same `HATCHDOOR_MCP_MAX_BASE64_BYTES` cap `import_attachment` uses on the way in, and rejected with the measured size when the file is over it. Either way the result carries `vault_id`, `relative_path`, `size_bytes`, and `content_type`.

> [!note]
> Fetching that URL with the MCP token is held to the same limits as fetching the bytes over `/mcp`: the same `HATCHDOOR_MCP_MAX_BASE64_BYTES` ceiling (a larger attachment returns `413`, so use the web token or raise the setting) and the same per-token rate quota, drawn from the same counter, answering `429` with `Retry-After`. The URL is a cheaper transport, not a larger allowance. Turning MCP off revokes it on the very next request, with no restart. See [[The security model]].

## Write content tools

Every tool below requires `HATCHDOOR_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED=true` and takes `vault_id` in addition to the parameters listed. Every mutating tool that targets an existing note also requires `expected_content_hash` — the hash most recently read from `get_note`, or from `get_frontmatter` when the body is not needed — for optimistic concurrency: a stale hash means someone else changed the note since you read it, and the write is rejected rather than silently overwriting.

A write is refused before it touches the file, so a rejected write has changed nothing and can be retried against a fresh hash. The exception is `write_recovery_required`, which means the opposite: the new content was saved and then could not be checked or undone, because something outside Hatchdoor changed the Vault directory mid-write. Do not retry it. The message names the note and the leftover file holding the previous content, and a person has to decide what the note should say.

| Tool | Required parameters (beyond `vault_id`) | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_note` | `relative_path`, `content` | Create a Markdown note. Parent folders are created automatically. Fails if the note exists unless `overwrite: true`. |
| `update_note` | `slug`, `content`, `expected_content_hash` | Replace a note's full content. |
| `append_to_note` | `slug`, `content`, `expected_content_hash` | Append content to a note. |
| `edit_note` | `slug`, `old_string`, `new_string`, `expected_content_hash` | Surgical string replacement. `old_string` must match exactly and be unique unless `replace_all: true`; otherwise the edit is rejected without writing. Prefer this over `update_note` for small changes. |
| `replace_section` | `slug`, `heading`, `mode`, `content`, `expected_content_hash` | Replace or insert around a Markdown section identified by its heading. `mode` is `replace` (overwrite the section — `content` should include the heading), `before`, or `after`. The section spans the heading through the next same-or-higher heading; headings inside fenced code blocks are ignored, and the heading must match exactly and be unique. |
| `update_frontmatter` | `slug`, `frontmatter`, `expected_content_hash` | Shallow top-level merge into the note's YAML frontmatter, leaving the body untouched. Only the keys you name change: the rest of the block keeps the formatting you gave it, so your key order, one-line lists, indentation, quoting and comments all survive a write. An explicit `null` deletes a key; a nested mapping is replaced wholesale rather than merged into. A list you replace keeps the shape it had, and a key that did not exist is added at the end of the block with any list on one line. The whole call is refused, writing nothing, when a key you named cannot be changed without guessing, which in practice means a note whose block writes that key twice. A note with no frontmatter block gets one created, and deleting its last key removes the block rather than leaving an empty one. Rejects an empty `frontmatter` object, and a creation whose values are all `null`. |
| `rename_note` | `slug`, `new_title`, `expected_content_hash` | Rename within the current folder; rewrites wikilink backlinks. The note keeps its folder, so the assets kept inside that folder stay exactly where they are and `moved_assets` comes back `0`. |
| `move_note` | `slug`, `target_folder`, `expected_content_hash` | Move to a target folder; same backlink handling as rename, and carries along the assets kept inside the note's own folder. |
| `move_rename_note` | `slug`, `target_relative_path`, `expected_content_hash` | Move and rename in one operation. |
| `archive_note` | `slug`, `expected_content_hash` | Move to the configured archive folder (the Vault's own `archive_folder`, set via `create_vault`/`edit_vault` above, or the instance default). |
| `delete_note` | `slug`, `expected_content_hash` | Trash a note under `.hatchdoor-trash`; removes backlinks to it and trashes the assets kept inside its own folder. |
| `import_attachment` | `content` (base64), `target_relative_path` | Upload an attachment by sending its bytes base64-encoded. This is the **fallback** for clients that cannot make an out-of-band HTTP request — size-limited (`HATCHDOOR_MCP_MAX_BASE64_BYTES`, default 5 MiB decoded). Prefer `POST /api/v1/vaults/{vault_id}/attachments` when possible; call `get_attachment_import_config` first to see current limits. |
| `move_attachment` | `source_relative_path`, `target_relative_path` | Move an attachment and rewrite every note reference to it. |
| `rename_attachment` | `source_relative_path`, `new_filename` | Rename an attachment in place and rewrite every note reference to it. |
| `delete_attachment` | `source_relative_path` | Trash an attachment under `.hatchdoor-trash` and rewrite every note reference to it. |

These three act on bytes the Vault already stores, so the upload allowlist does not gate them: any file that is not Markdown qualifies, whatever its extension, including files with no extension at all. Four things are refused. A `.md` target, because moving a note this way would skip backlink rewriting, slug handling and the hash check — use the note tools. A `.hatchdoor-layer` marker, because trashing one would silently promote a whole folder back onto the default surface. Anything under `.git`, which is the Vault's repository rather than its content. And any path the Vault excludes as noise, on the source side as well as the destination, which is what keeps these tools out of `.obsidian/`. Reference rewriting still keys on the extension, so a link to an extensionless file is left as written when that file moves. See [[How to import and work with attachments]] for the three lists — uploadable, managed, fetchable — and how they differ.

A backlink to a note that `rename_note`, `move_note`, `move_rename_note` or `archive_note` retargets keeps the form it was written in. A link written as a bare title, `[[Some Note]]`, stays a bare title and picks up the note's new title; a link written as a full path picks up the new full path. The one exception is a new title that another note already carries, where the link falls back to the full path so it keeps pointing at the note that moved. A move that does not change the note's title therefore leaves bare-title links alone entirely. The note being renamed or moved is one more note holding links to it, so a link in its own body that points at itself follows the same rules: after a rename a bare-title self-link picks up the new title, and after a move a path-qualified self-link picks up the new folder while a bare-title one is left alone. `rewritten_notes` counts only the other notes that changed, so a rename whose one stale link was the note's own comes back as `0`; the note's own new text is covered by the `content_hash` in the same response. `delete_note` is the exception, and leaves the trashed copy's link to itself as written. A link inside a table cell writes its alias pipe escaped, as `[[Some Note\|alias]]`, because a bare `|` would end the cell. That escape is part of the form as well: the link is retargeted and the backslash is handed back, so the cell stays a valid table row.

An asset travels with a note only when it already lives inside that note's own folder, or a subfolder of it. An asset the note merely points at from somewhere else, such as a shared `_system/` or `Attachments/` folder sitting beside the note's folder, stays exactly where it is: `rename_note`, `move_note`, `move_rename_note`, `archive_note` and `delete_note` leave it alone and rewrite the moved note's own link so it still resolves from the note's new home. Other notes pointing at it are left untouched too, since nothing about it changed. `moved_assets` in the response counts only the assets that actually moved.

> [!note]
> A note sitting in the Vault root has the whole Vault as its own folder, so every asset it references counts as living inside it and does travel with the note when it moves to another folder. A rename keeps the note where it is, so nothing travels. Keep notes that share an attachments folder in a folder of their own if you want that folder left alone.

Every write tool accepts an optional `commit_summary`, a one-line string describing what the change was for. On a Vault with versioning enabled it reaches the body of the commit that records that write. One commit usually covers several writes, since Hatchdoor commits on a schedule rather than per call: the subject names the first few operations and how many files they touched, and the body lists one `- ` line per summary, in the order the writes happened. A write with no summary still shapes the subject. Pass one on every write and the Vault's history reads as a log of why each note changed.

> No write tool can create, rename, or move a file named `.hatchdoor-layer` (the layer marker) — that call is rejected outright, since a marker silently changes how a whole folder is classified and is meant to be edited directly in the Vault. Writes are also rejected if the target path matches the Vault's own noise-exclusion patterns, since such a file would be written to disk but stay invisible to every read surface.

### Response shape

A successful note write returns `vault_id`, `slug`, `relative_path`, `content_hash` (use this for the next write), `layer`, `quality_warnings`, `rewritten_notes` (other notes whose backlinks were updated), `moved_assets`, and `trashed_path` (set only by `delete_note`). A successful attachment write returns `vault_id`, `attachment`, `rewritten_notes`, `trashed_path`, and `cleanup_warning`.

A write conflict (stale `expected_content_hash`, or a registry revision that moved under a Vault-management call) is reported as a retryable tool error — re-read the current state and retry rather than assuming the operation is unsafe to repeat.

Any read or write refused this way says so twice: `isError` is true on the result itself, and the structured result carries `ok: false` beside the `code`, `message`, `retryable` and, where the failure names a Vault, `vault_id`. Branch on whichever of the two you already read. The second signal matters if you read the structured result as the tool's typed answer, since the schema each tool advertises describes only the success payload and a refusal arrives in a different shape. The rule is that an `ok` field present and false means the call did not happen: a successful write still returns `ok: true`, and a successful read carries no `ok` field at all. The exception is the handful of setup-state refusals, returned before setup finishes or once a search model is chosen, which carry a plain sentence and no structured result to read.

## Batch

`batch` runs an ordered list of the tools above in a single call. There is one such tool, not a batching variant per tool: each item names an `op` and carries that tool's own `arguments` exactly as a standalone call would, `vault_id` included, so one batch can span several Vaults.

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {"op": "create_note", "arguments": {"vault_id": "<id>", "relative_path": "Inbox/Draft.md", "content": "# Draft\n"}},
    {"op": "update_frontmatter", "arguments": {"vault_id": "<id>", "slug": "inbox/draft", "frontmatter": {"tags": ["status/draft"]}, "expected_content_hash": "ignored-here"}},
    {"op": "get_note", "arguments": {"vault_id": "<id>", "slug": "inbox/draft"}}
  ]
}
```

**What may go in.** Every read tool except `list_vaults`, and every note and attachment write tool — `create_note` through `delete_attachment`, deletes included. Vault-management tools (`create_vault`, `edit_vault`, `enable_vault`, `disable_vault`, `disconnect_vault`, `sync_vault`, `retry_vault`, `refresh_vault`) and the model-setup tools are not batchable, and neither is `batch` itself. An unknown or disallowed `op`, an empty `operations` array, more than **50** read-shaped items, or more than **20** write-shaped items rejects the whole call up front, before any item executes.

**Best-effort, in order, no rollback.** Items run one after another; an item that fails never stops the ones after it, and nothing already written is undone. There is no mid-batch visibility either — an item sees the Vault, not the batch's own bookkeeping, apart from the hash chaining below.

**Permission is still per item.** `batch` itself is not gated on write mode, because a batch may be entirely read-only. Each write-shaped item is gated exactly as the same call would be standalone: with `HATCHDOOR_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED=false` the read items succeed and the write items fail individually, and a Vault whose `capabilities.mutate` is false refuses its writes the same way.

**`expected_content_hash` inside a batch.** Once a batch has written a note, later items in that same call targeting the same `vault_id` + `slug` have their `expected_content_hash` replaced with the hash that write produced — you cannot know the intermediate hash without the round trip a batch exists to avoid, so supply any placeholder for it and it is discarded. This applies to `create_note` too: create a note and edit it later in the same call. A note the batch has *not* already written validates its `expected_content_hash` normally, exactly like a standalone call. The relaxation never leaks outside the call — Hatchdoor holds each touched Vault's mutation lock from that Vault's first write through the end of the batch, so no outside writer can slip in behind a substituted hash.

**Result shape.** `items` (one entry per requested operation, carrying `index`, `op`, `ok`, and then either `result` — that tool's own normal result — or `error`), plus `succeeded` and `failed` counts. A batch that ran at all returns success at the tool level; read `failed` and the per-item `ok` flags, never the call's own status, to find out what happened.

**Cost to everyone else.** From its first write to a Vault until the call ends, a batch holds that Vault's write lock. Other writers to the same Vault — the Web UI, another agent, the HTTP API — wait for it. That is what makes the hash chaining safe and what keeps the batch's writes in one Git commit, but it means a 20-write batch against a busy Vault is a pause other writers feel. Reads are unaffected.

Vault changes made by a batch are committed together on the Vault's next Git sync turn, the same as any other burst of writes. (On the legacy single-Vault sync path, a batch's writes may land in more than one commit; nothing is lost or reordered, only the commit boundary differs.)

A batch is a single `tools/call`, so it costs one call against the per-token rate limit (`HATCHDOOR_MCP_RATE_LIMITS_ENABLED` in [[Settings and environment variables reference]]) no matter how many items it carries — which is most of the reason to reach for it. The item caps above are the tool's own, enforced separately.
