# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Fork: the WebDAV vault source was removed.** The fork previously added a
  `VaultSource::WebDav` (RFC-4918 client, mirror sync engine, sync-turn scheduler,
  settings UI) so a vault living on Google Drive could be attached through an
  `rclone serve webdav` sidecar. That whole feature is gone: the client
  (`src/vault/remote/`), the enum variant, `VaultWorkKind::WebDav`, the scheduler
  wiring, the frontend "Add a Vault → WebDAV endpoint" option and the unit tests.
  The `roxmltree` and `reqwest` dependencies went with it (the deployment no longer
  holds any Google credential for its vault). **Why:** the feature existed to serve
  one deployment's remote vault, and that deployment now mounts the vault over SMB
  and registers it as a plain `Local` source — no fork code involved. Keeping an
  unused vault-source implementation meant re-integrating it by hand into upstream's
  restructured code on every release merge, which is the real cost of a fork-only
  delta. **Migrating a Vault:** anything that pointed at a `web_dav` source should
  point at a mounted directory instead (bind the mount into the container, then
  register the Vault as `Local`). A registry that still contains a `web_dav` Vault
  no longer loads — remove that entry, or check out the commit before the removal.
  Docs: `FORK.md` → *Removal of the WebDAV vault source*.

- **The fork now tracks upstream v2.6.1** (merged in `4e568cc`, 176 upstream commits
  since the previous fork point `e631857`/v2.5.0). Upstream's v2.6.0 and v2.6.1 release
  notes are in this file below; the fork's own deltas (WebDAV vault source + sync
  reconciliation, fuse write/index resilience, dependency security pins) were carried
  through the merge unchanged in behaviour.

- **WebDAV sync is now a full reconciliation, not additive-only.** Previously
  the sync engine pulled remote files missing locally and pushed any local file
  the remote did not list, but never refreshed files present on both sides and
  never removed mirror files whose remote counterpart had been deleted. On a
  WebDAV-sourced vault (the Google Drive build), Obsidian-side deletions stayed
  in the mirror/index and were re-uploaded to gdrive every sync turn, while
  Obsidian edits to existing notes never reached the mirror. The engine now:
  refreshes files whose remote fingerprint (size + etag) changed since the last
  successful turn; deletes mirror files/dirs whose remote counterpart is gone
  (never re-uploading them); pushes only files Hatchdoor itself created or
  modified since the last successful sync; tolerates a subcollection 404
  mid-walk instead of aborting the whole turn; and persists per-vault sync
  fingerprints in a `.hatchdoor/webdav-sync.json` sidecar written atomically.
  `.hatchdoor/` was added to the built-in noise-exclusion patterns so the
  sidecar never wakes the vault watcher. Sync turn outcomes are logged at info
  (`pulled/refreshed/pushed/deleted/created_dirs/errors`).

- **A local edit to a note that already exists on the remote is published again.**
  The reconciliation pass above only ever uploaded mirror files the remote did not
  list, so a note edited after the previous sync turn stayed stranded: its remote
  fingerprint had not changed, so nothing refreshed it, and it was not missing
  remotely, so nothing pushed it. The turn now decides per file — a mirror copy
  Hatchdoor modified since the last successful turn (`mtime > last_sync_at`) is
  uploaded, and a mirror copy left untouched since then whose bytes do not have the
  remote's size is re-downloaded as stale. On the Drive vault this had stranded six
  notes written by the 2026-09-14 documentation pass, plus one truncated local copy.

## v2.6.1 - 2026-09-08

The follow-up release, and there is nothing new to learn in it. These are the fixes that came out of running v2.6.0 in earnest, plus one tool that should never have gone missing. Vaults that were quietly not committing your notes now commit them. Links inside tables, and links a note makes to itself, stop breaking on rename. The editor puts the caret where you clicked, and `query_notes` is back.

### Added
- Switching the Vault selector now takes you to that Vault's own last note. Until now it narrowed the sidebar and left the previous Vault's note sitting on screen, so every switch meant hunting for where you had been. Hatchdoor already remembers the note you were last reading and returns you to it when you reopen the app; it now remembers one per Vault and applies the same rule to a switch. Pick a Vault you have not read anything in yet and you land on the empty start page with that Vault's notes in the explorer, rather than on someone else's note. Choosing **All Vaults** moves you nowhere, and neither does switching while you are in Settings, Statistics or the graph, where the selector is a filter rather than a request to go and read something. A Vault that you remove or pause loses its remembered note, and a note deleted since you last read it shows as missing once, until you open another note in that Vault. [#291]
- Agents can now tell which build they are talking to. The MCP server instructions end with the running version, and `get_stats` reports it as `hatchdoor_version`. Release builds report the plain version (for example `2.6.1`); images built with the new `GIT_SHA` Docker build arg report it as `2.6.1 (dev abc1234)`, which also appears in the startup log and MCP `serverInfo`. [#263], [#264]

### Under the hood
No behaviour change, but it affects anyone who builds the image from source.

- Building the Docker image now requires BuildKit, which current Docker releases use by default. A client pinned to the legacy builder fails outright rather than silently skipping the new cache steps. Cargo's registry, Git checkouts and `target/` directory persist between builds through BuildKit cache mounts, so a rebuild after an ordinary source edit reuses the previous compilation instead of repeating it. A new `verification` build target runs `cargo test --locked` as a non-root user inside the image. Prune the layer cache and the cache mounts together or not at all; clearing only the mounts leaves the build in a state that recompiles every dependency. [#270]

### Fixed
- Following a link to another note from inside a note body reloaded the whole app. The explorer, the recently-viewed list and every Vault tree were thrown away and rebuilt from scratch, which on a large collection is a visible wait, and the same click from the sidebar or the Links panel had always been instant. Those links were plain browser links; they now go through the app's own navigation, like every other way of opening a note. Only note links change. An attachment, a PDF and an external link still hand the click to the browser, because that is what opening a file means. A link that carries a heading, `[[Note#Section]]`, still lands on the heading: with the page no longer reloading, Hatchdoor scrolls there itself once the note it names has rendered, rather than the browser doing it on the way in. [#294]
- Clicking into the second line of a wrapped list item shoved its text to the right, further the deeper the list was nested. Hatchdoor hides the Markdown you are not looking at, so entering a block slides that hidden syntax out into the left margin and the words you are reading stay put. The leading spaces that carry a wrapped line onto its next line were never treated as hidden, so they arrived as ordinary text and pushed the line over. They are now, and so is the indentation in front of an indented heading or quote, which had the same problem. Two neighbouring faults came out with it. Every heading moved about 23 pixels on entry, indented or not, because the size of its `#` was being measured in the wrong font, and by a different amount depending on which block you had clicked before it; headings now hold still. An indented code block, the kind written with four leading spaces rather than fences, keeps its spaces on screen on purpose, so it is now left alone instead of being dragged left. One limit worth knowing: the margin a line hides its indentation in is much narrower on a phone than on a desktop, so a heavily nested line still shifts a little there, just less than it did. [#286]
- The caret landed too far left in a wrapped or indented block, further off the deeper the nesting went. The map from what you see to your Markdown skipped the block's leading marker once, at the top, and then counted every later line's indentation as text that renders, so clicking the first word of a list item's second line put the caret inside the indent. The map now finds the source line your click fell on and measures within it, skipping that line's own indent and marker. A single-line block has exactly one line, so every answer it gave before is unchanged. A fenced code block had two faults pulling opposite ways: its offset arrived inflated by the language label and the Copy button, which have no character behind them in your Markdown, while the opening fence was read as emphasis followed by the language name. Neither could be fixed alone. The caret is now measured across the code block it landed in, and the fences are skipped whole. [#284]
- Clicking into a paragraph that holds a wikilink put the caret somewhere else, usually inside the link's target. Hatchdoor opens a block for editing at the character you clicked, and it works out which character that is from an offset the browser reports. The browser measures that offset inside the one small piece of text under the pointer; Hatchdoor read it as an offset across the whole block. The two agree only when a block is a single unbroken run of text, which is why plain prose had always been right and anything carrying a link, bold, italic or inline code had not. The offset is converted before it is used now, so the caret lands where you clicked. [#269]
- Narrowing the Vault selector quietly pinned search to that one Vault, and the search panel's Vault list, the one thing that would have said so, was hidden in exactly that state. A query whose matches lived in another Vault came back as "No matching notes", with nothing on screen to suggest anything had been left out. Search now asks every enabled Vault whatever the sidebar is set to, and the Vault list is always there: it opens on the Vault you were browsing, so what you see first is unchanged, and the other Vaults sit beside it with their match counts, one click away. On a phone the same list is the **Scope** field under the search box. One consequence worth knowing: a search now shares its 50 results across your whole collection rather than spending them on one Vault, so a single Vault can show fewer rows than it used to. [#289]
- Typing quickly into search could take the rest of the app down with it. A semantic search took one of the four available read leases on the database and only then ran your query through the embedding model, which handles one query at a time. Every queued search sat on a lease while touching no database at all, so four keystrokes ahead of the model were enough to hold all four, and anything else arriving, a folder tree, the recent list, another search, was refused immediately with `503` for as long as you kept typing. The query is embedded before a lease is taken now, so a lease covers only the database work. A request that arrives with all four in use waits for the next free one rather than taking an error, because that ceiling exists to bound how many database handles are open at once and was never meant to shed load. [#287]
- A note write could be reported as failed after it had already been saved. Hatchdoor commits a conditional write by swapping the new file into place and then reading back what it displaced, to check the note had not changed since you read it. If that read-back failed, the swap was supposed to be undone, but the result of the undo was never checked. The undo needs the same file the read just failed on, so when something outside Hatchdoor removed that file mid-write, the undo failed too and was ignored: the new content stayed saved while the API answered `500`, and an agent retrying then got a conflict because the note no longer matched the hash it had sent. One user's server log showed exactly this on a `PUT`. A write that lands but cannot be verified now reports `write_recovery_required` and says so in full, naming the note and the leftover file holding the previous content, because only a person can decide what the note should say. The same reporting fix covers two neighbouring cases: a concurrent change that could not be restored, and a fully verified write whose leftover file could not be cleaned up, which used to fail an otherwise perfect save. A write that Hatchdoor did undo still reports the original failure, and nothing about the normal conflict answer changes. Recovery messages carry the note's name only, never the server path it sits at. [#288]
- Selecting notes by tag, path or frontmatter property came back. It shipped in v2.3.0 as `query_notes`, the multi-vault rewrite retired the tool, and nothing replaced it, so "every note tagged `project/active`", "everything under `40-reference`" and "notes whose `review-date` has passed" had no answer for anyone. A `#tag` prefix on a search query was the only survivor and it answers the simplest case alone. The tool is back with an explicit Vault scope, like every other collection read: a list of conditions over tags (nested tags included), a Vault-relative folder prefix, and frontmatter properties tested for equality, ordered comparison, existence or emptiness. It selects rather than searches — a note either qualifies or it does not, results come back unranked in the same order every time, and no embedding is involved, so a Vault that is still being indexed answers in full. Nothing about search itself changed. [#274]
- Setting one frontmatter field rewrote the whole block. `update_frontmatter` used to read the block, apply your change, and write the block back out from scratch, which meant it also re-sorted every key into alphabetical order and broke every one-line list, `tags: [work, urgent]`, into a line per item. Nobody asked for either. Across the sample Vaults that ship with Hatchdoor, 530 of the 531 notes with frontmatter write their lists on one line, so in practice an agent doing routine tagging reformatted every note it touched, and the change you actually made was buried in the noise. Only the keys you name change now. Everything else in the block comes back exactly as you wrote it: your key order, your one-line lists, your indentation, your quote marks, your comments, your blank lines. A value like `1.50` stays `1.50` instead of becoming `1.5`. A list you replace keeps the shape it had, and a key that did not exist is added at the bottom of the block with any list on one line. Two things are refused now that were not before, in both cases without touching the file: naming a key that the note writes twice, because there is no way to tell which one you meant, and a block laid out so unusually that Hatchdoor cannot edit it without risking the rest of it. Notes an earlier version already reformatted stay as they are; there is no repair pass. [#257]
- Renaming a note left that note's links to itself pointing at the name it used to have. The pass that retargets every link to a moving note walks the whole Vault and skipped exactly one note: the one being moved, on the assumption that a note has nothing to say about its own name. A note that links to itself, ordinary enough in an index or a hub page, is the case that assumption misses, and nothing surfaced it. The write reported success and the stale link was counted nowhere. A moving note is now one more note holding links to the target, on rename, move and archive alike, and its self-links follow the same rules as every other note's. The reported count of rewritten notes still means other notes, since the moved note's own change is already reported by the operation itself. Delete is unchanged. [#254]
- A wikilink written inside a Markdown table was invisible to everything in Hatchdoor that reads links. A bare `|` closes a table cell, so an alias in a table has to be escaped as `[[Some Note\|alias]]`. Every link reader cut the link at the first `|` without checking what preceded it, so the target came out as `Some Note\`, the trailing backslash was then read as a folder separator, and the lookup asked for a note that cannot exist. A link resolving to nothing is the one case where leaving it alone is correct, which is why a run of 384 renames broke eight links and reported success. The escape is understood everywhere links are read from, out of one shared place rather than five copies: rename, move, archive and delete retarget such a link and count the note, it appears in outgoing links, backlinks and the graph, `resolve_wikilink` resolves it to the same note as the unescaped form, the reader renders it labelled with its alias, and `![[image.png\|200]]` resolves its image. The escape travels with the rewritten link, so the table row stays valid. An escaped link inside inline code or a fenced block is left byte for byte alone, as an unescaped one already was. Links a previous version already broke are not repaired; the next rename that touches one fixes it. [#252]
- An agent could be told its write was refused and not notice. When a tool call fails for an actionable reason, a stale content hash being the common one, Hatchdoor marks the whole result as an error and puts the reason in the result's structured half. Some clients read only that structured half, because every tool publishes a schema for it and that is the documented way to get a typed answer. The problem: the refusal used to arrive with nothing in it saying "this is a refusal", so a client following that path read a rejected rename as a completed one and moved on. One user hit exactly this and only found the missing rename afterwards, by diffing their whole Vault against a snapshot. A refused call now carries `ok: false` in its structured result alongside the existing `code`, `message` and `retryable`. Nothing else moves: the error flag on the result is unchanged, a successful write still returns `ok: true`, read results still carry no `ok` field, per-item results inside `batch` are untouched, and every tool's published schema is byte for byte what it was. The rule for a client is now simply that an `ok` field present and false means the call did not happen. [#255]
- A file in your Vault that Hatchdoor would not accept as an upload could not be moved, renamed or deleted either, which made every `.mp4` clip, voice memo, `.csv` and `.zip` permanently immovable. The upload allowlist is a policy about what may enter a Vault; it was being applied to bytes the Vault already stores. Worse was the quiet half: the planner that decides what travels with a moving note did not recognise those files at all, so a note moved to a new folder left its videos behind pointing at nothing, reported success, and `list_note_attachments` showed no sign of them. Attachment operations now accept any file that is not Markdown, whatever its extension, and every non-Markdown file a note references is listed and travels with it under the existing rules. What may be uploaded is unchanged, and so is what Hatchdoor will display: a video can now be organised but still cannot be fetched or rendered, which the attachment guide spells out. Four things the attachment tools will not touch, some of which the old extension check was only blocking by accident: a note, a `.hatchdoor-layer` marker, anything under `.git`, and anything in a folder the Vault excludes as noise, `.obsidian/` included. [#247]
- A Vault set to **Local history** committed once, when it was activated, and never again. Every note written after that sat uncommitted until the process restarted, while the Vault reported ready and each write returned success. **Two-way** had a milder form of the same fault: its commit was bundled into the turn that also fetches and pushes, and that turn runs on the sync schedule, which defaults to once a day. Committing is local, free, and cannot fail for a reason outside your machine; talking to a remote is none of those and already has a schedule you set. They are separate pieces of background work now. The file watcher asks for a commit as soon as your changes land, and asks for it before the search reindex so a commit does not wait out a rebuild that can run for minutes. Fetch, merge and push stay exactly where they were, on the Vault's poll interval. Every way a commit can fail needs a person, so a Vault that hits one stops committing automatically for five minutes, then resumes already owing the turn it missed and catches up on its own once you have fixed the cause. **Sync now** and **Try again** stop refusing a Vault that has no remote and commit it instead; the refusal now narrows to a Vault with no Git at all. A **Pull-only** Vault plans no commit turn, because it refuses writes and has to leave a folder its operator dirtied alone. [#267]
- Every write tool advertised a `commit_summary`, the operating rules handed to agents told them to send one on every write, and the value was read and then dropped. Local history committed with nothing in the message body and two-way committed the literal line `hatchdoor: record local Vault changes` every turn, so agents spent tokens composing summaries that reached nothing and a Vault's history could not answer why any note changed. The summaries reach the commit now. One commit usually records several writes, so each write's summary waits between landing on disk and being committed, and the commit that records them names itself from the batch: a title saying what changed, then one line per summary. A turn that commits nothing, or fails, keeps the lines it still owes rather than swallowing them. A write from a surface that has no such field still shapes the commit title and simply adds no body line. [#249]
- Hatchdoor invented tags out of citation numbers and code samples. A link written as `[discussion #1177](https://example.com/x/1177)` is one whitespace-separated word, and the test for a namespace slash ran against the whole of it, URL included, while only the leading `#1177` was stored. So a bare `1177` was filed as a tag, even though bare numbers are meant to be rejected. The test now runs against the same text that gets stored. Tag extraction is aware of code as well: a hashtag inside a fenced block or an inline code span is not a tag, so a note documenting a tag convention is no longer filed under the tags it documents. Tags are derived from your Markdown, so an existing Vault corrects itself on its next index turn with nothing for you to do. [#248]
- A public demo told its visitors they could write to it. The unauthenticated Vault list copied each Vault's capabilities straight from the running instance, where they answer a question about the Vault, is this folder writable, does this source have a remote to pull, is there a failure worth retrying. That is the right answer for an operator, whose request is admitted. On a demo it is the wrong one: every mutating route and every Vault-control route is refused before its handler runs, so `mutate`, `pull` and `retry` all named requests that could only fail, and the live demo advertised `mutate: true` on all four of its Vaults. No door was open and nothing here weakens the guard; it is a reporting fix, and a demo reports those four as false. Browse and search stay as they were, because those reads do real work on a demo, and a demo Vault sitting on a writable folder still reports that folder read-write next to `mutate: false`, the same pairing a pull-only Git Vault already has. The authenticated list is unchanged. [#243]

## v2.6.0 - 2026-09-03

The MCP release. Agents get five new tools, a modern protocol revision, and a `get_tree` that no longer hands over the entire Vault when you asked about one folder. Everyone else gets a Git schedule that actually fires, a read-only mount that actually mounts, and a write layer that stops refusing to rename a note because of the picture sitting next to it.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes — action required on upgrade
- **`GET /api/index-status`, `GET /api/git-status` and `GET /api/vault-status` are gone**, and all three return `404`. Each described a single Vault back when there was only ever one. The two Settings consoles they fed, **Search index** and **Versioning**, leave the Settings page with them, along with their two-second polling. Each Vault's own settings page keeps its condition, its last error, and its **Sync now**, **Try again** and **Rebuild search index** buttons, and the scope zone and explorer still show a Vault as indexing.
  **Action:** point uptime checks at `/api/startup-status`, which is unchanged and remains the unauthenticated startup probe, and anything asking about a specific Vault at `GET /api/v1/vaults`, which reports each Vault's condition, its last search or versioning error, and whether it is indexing. Nothing in Hatchdoor's configuration brings the old routes back. [#183]
- **`PATCH /api/settings` no longer asks you to confirm `git_init` or `git_downgrade`.** Those consequences belonged to the instance-wide versioning lifecycle that the retired **Versioning** console explained, and no current deployment reaches it. A save that turns on local versioning, or switches off remote versioning, now applies on the first request instead of answering `409` and waiting for a resend.
  **Action:** remove those two values from any API client, since an unknown consequence is refused as a validation error. `reindex` is unaffected and still confirmed exactly as before, and per-Vault Git changes keep their own confirmations on `/api/v1/vaults/{vault_id}`.
- **MCP protocol revisions `2025-03-26` and `2025-06-18` are no longer served.** The endpoint advertises and accepts exactly `2026-07-28` and `2025-11-25`. A client pinned to a dropped revision is refused on the protocol-version header rather than silently downgraded.
  **Action:** if an MCP client stops connecting after this upgrade, check which revision it pins and update it. Nothing in Hatchdoor's own configuration restores the dropped ones.
- **Notes inside a `get_tree` result no longer carry `vault_id`.** It was a third of the payload, and the tree already names its Vault once at the top.
  **Action:** read the Vault from the tree root. Flat results that mix Vaults in one list, `search_notes` and `recently_modified`, keep their per-note `vault_id` and need no change. [#211]
- **The instance-wide Git and exclusion environment variables no longer do anything at runtime.** `HATCHDOOR_GIT_SYNC_ENABLED`, `HATCHDOOR_GIT_REMOTE`, `HATCHDOOR_GIT_BRANCH`, `HATCHDOOR_GIT_HTTPS_USERNAME`, `HATCHDOOR_GIT_HTTPS_TOKEN`, `HATCHDOOR_GIT_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` and `HATCHDOOR_EXCLUDE` stay in Settings and keep their values, but nothing acts on them while the server runs. They are inputs to importing a pre-2.5.0 deployment on first boot, and are otherwise only checked for validity at startup. Each Vault's own exclusion patterns and Git mode are what apply, and saving one of these no longer creates or reconfigures a Git repository as a side effect.
  **Action:** set exclusions and Git mode per Vault, in that Vault's settings. `HATCHDOOR_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `HATCHDOOR_GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` are unaffected. They remain the commit identity a Vault without its own falls back to, and a change to either still reaches the next Git turn without a restart. [#185]

### Added
- **Read and write a note's properties without touching its body.** `get_frontmatter` returns the tags, aliases and other keys alone; `update_frontmatter` merges keys in and leaves your Markdown byte-for-byte identical. [#175]
- **`get_frontmatter` also hands back the note's `content_hash`.** Every hash-protected write wants one, and the only way to get one was to pull the whole note body over the wire. A migration over hundreds of notes no longer reads every body to learn a 16-character string. [#227]
- **`get_attachment` pulls a file back out of a Vault**, the mirror image of importing one. A download URL by default, base64 inline for clients that cannot fetch out of band. [#176]
- **`batch` runs up to 50 reads or 20 writes as one call and one commit.** Content hashes chain inside it, so an agent can create a note and edit it again later in the same batch without reading it back. Best-effort, no rollback. [#177]
- **`get_tree` takes `folder`, `max_depth` and `include_notes`.** Asking about one folder used to cost you the whole Vault. On a 530-note Vault the orientation call is 13x smaller than the full tree. [#192], [#211]
- **`refresh_vault` asks one Vault for its next index turn.** Collection reads have always said when they have fallen behind the Markdown, and an agent had no way to act on that: `sync_vault` and `retry_vault` both resolve a Git poll interval first and refuse any Vault without a remote, so a plain local Vault had no MCP path to a rebuild at all. It answers `queued` on an idle Vault and `coalesced` when a turn is already pending, so repeat requests cannot pile turns onto one Vault. [#228]
- **Every MCP tool ships an `outputSchema`**, so a client can validate a result instead of inferring its shape. [#167]
- **The MCP endpoint speaks protocol revision `2026-07-28`**: stateless discovery, no handshake, and one opt-in `subscriptions/listen` stream in place of SSE subscribe and unsubscribe. Clients on `2025-11-25` are unaffected. [#169], [#170]
- **MCP now has rate limits.** 120 calls a minute per token, 8 concurrent calls and 2 concurrent searches, refused with `429` and a `Retry-After`. Set `HATCHDOOR_MCP_RATE_LIMITS_ENABLED=false` to switch them off. [#171]
- **The Vault asset route accepts an MCP bearer token**, so an agent can fetch the URL `get_attachment` hands it without also holding the web token. It spends the same quota and size limits as any MCP call. [#174]
- **The public documentation Vault gained Guides, Concepts and a settings reference**, and the README links into it rather than duplicating it.
- **The public demo and the documentation site link to each other now.** Each demo Vault points at the documentation page behind its layout, and the documentation's layout table links to the live Vault demonstrating each method.

### Fixed
- A Vault on a `:ro` Docker bind mount refused to come up at all, which is an awkward position for a product that supports read-only browsing. Read-only mounts answer the write probe with `EROFS`, and only "permission denied" counted as present but not writable. Such a Vault now activates read-only. [#178]
- If you redeployed more often than your Git poll interval, a scheduled sync never fired once. Every process start re-armed the countdown from zero, so the only Git turns that ever ran were activations and manual syncs. The schedule was, in the strict sense, decorative. Each Vault now remembers when its last turn completed and resumes the countdown across a restart. [#200]
- Straight after a restart, a Vault whose Git credentials were failing reported `pending` with no error, for up to a day on the default schedule. Activation now republishes the last known outcome, message included. [#200]
- A Vault's read model could wedge permanently, and one new note was enough to do it. A slug comes from a filename alone, so two notes with the same stem in different folders compete for it, and the index build tried to give it to the arriving note while the departing one still held it. That failed the whole Index turn, and the next turn seeded from the same snapshot and failed at the same note, forever: `get_tree`, `get_graph` and `get_stats` reported `partial` at a frozen `collection_revision` while exact note reads stayed correct. The build now releases a moving slug before any note claims it, and a wedged cache recovers on its first turn with nothing deleted and no cache wiped. [#226]
- An Index turn held the Vault's write lock for the whole turn, embedding included, so a write arriving during a multi-minute pass on a CPU-only host did not slow down, it parked. The caller's transport gave up on a write that then landed anyway, which is an at-least-once hazard the moment the caller retries. The lock now covers the turn's read phase only, and a Vault that took a write while it was released publishes itself stale rather than fresh and lets the watcher's catch-up turn sort it out. [#223]
- A note holding a real image, PDF or archive could not be moved, renamed, archived or deleted, and neither could the file itself. The check run after an asset move read the file as text, so any byte that was not valid UTF-8 rolled the whole write back with "refusing to move unsafe source". The suite stayed green on this because every attachment fixture wrote the ASCII string `png` into a file named `.png`. The check now asserts an ordinary file and reads nothing. [#220]
- A note referencing an asset outside its own folder could not be moved at all. The planner assumed every referenced asset was a sibling and built its destination by joining the reference onto the note's folder, so a link such as `../Attachments/image.png` carried its `..` all the way down to the move primitives, which refuse anything but plain names. An asset now travels with a note only when it already lives inside that note's own folder, or a subfolder of it. One kept elsewhere, such as the shared attachments folder of the usual Obsidian layout, stays exactly where it is; only the moving note's own link is repointed, and no other note is touched. A note in the Vault root has the whole Vault as its folder, so everything it references still travels when it moves. [#225], [#231]
- `rename_note` refused any note that kept its picture beside it, and every note in the Vault root. A rename leaves the note in its folder, so an asset in that folder was already sitting at the destination computed for it, and the collision guard could not tell that apart from a genuine collision. A move to nowhere is now recognised as one: nothing moves, nothing is rewritten, and `moved_assets` reports `0`. A different file at an asset's destination still refuses, as before. [#238]
- One rename could rewrite a Vault's prose out of the style it was written in. Every backlink to the moved note was retargeted to its full vault-relative path, so `[[Some Note]]` came back as `[[folder/subfolder/Some Note]]`. The links still resolved, but the prose got noisier on every rename and nothing rewrote it back. A backlink now keeps the form it was authored in, with the full path as the fallback where the new title is one another note already carries. Aliases, anchors and fenced code are untouched. [#235]
- A writer saving faster than the watcher's quiet window deferred freshness for the whole burst. Every qualifying event restarted the 500 ms timer with no upper bound, so no Index turn was armed and the published snapshot could not advance until the writing stopped. The documented ceiling on that window is now enforced, and whichever of the two fires first wins. [#229]
- An agent that edited a note was told Hatchdoor was still being set up, on instances that finished setting up months ago, and was then handed model-setup tools that could change nothing. Following that advice produced a second, differently wrong answer. The routine reindex behind the write was sharing one status field with first-run model setup. [#191]
- After the backend restarted, the Vault list and its counts stopped updating until you reloaded the page. A new server counts revisions from zero again, and the client read that as stale. [#194]
- Opening a Vault's settings page mid-refresh could leave it describing a Vault the Settings index disagreed with for the rest of the visit. [#194]
- Dragging the sidebar resizer moved the note path in the topbar and left the pane itself where it was. The layout grid redeclared `--sidebar-width` at its 280px default, and a local declaration beats the live value inherited from the shell.
- Asking for a folder that no Vault has picked one Vault at random and blamed it by id. The refusal now names none of them, because none is more at fault than the others. [#211]
- Uploading a file called `.hatchdoor-layer` through the HTTP API silently reclassified a whole subtree as a demoted layer. It now returns `400 layer_marker_write`, as the MCP tools always did.
- In demo mode, an attachment in a hidden layer was still served to anyone who knew its URL. Asset requests now go through the same browse surface as note reads.
- Every semantic search embedded your query twice, once to retrieve and again during diversity backfill. It embeds it once.
- Setting `HOST=localhost` failed to parse and the server refused to start. It is accepted now, and the container health probe follows the listener's address family instead of guessing at it.
- A large note written through `update_note` or `archive_note` held up other MCP traffic while it was written. Both now write off the request thread, the way the HTTP routes always have, which also made three of their error payloads agree with their HTTP twins.
- The length of your configured bearer token could be measured from outside, because the comparison returned early on a length mismatch. Both sides are hashed to a fixed width first now.

### Under the hood
No behaviour change in any of these, but they are why the list above is as short as it is.

- The `/mcp` protocol boundary is the `rmcp` library rather than a hand-written JSON-RPC layer. Tool names, arguments, response shapes and the per-request security ordering are unchanged. [#168]
- The legacy single-Vault indexing and Git lane is deleted. Hatchdoor had been carrying a second, unreachable copy of both since v2.5.0. [#185]
- Every write, read and management operation crosses one Vault-qualified core now, with HTTP and MCP as thin adapters over it. That is why three MCP error payloads above could stop disagreeing with their HTTP twins. [#184], [#186], [#187], [#188]
- Index turns and Git turns run behind a single Vault work executor. [#197]
- The frontend reads the Vault collection through one client instead of several. [#198]
- The eval harness is behind a non-default `eval` cargo feature, cutting 17 crates from a default build. [#195]
- YAML parsing moved from the archived `serde_yaml` to `serde_yaml_ng`. [#196]
- The unreachable search filters, and the second semantic retrieval path they gated, are deleted. [#210]

## v2.5.0 - 2026-08-17

- Attachment embeds written the way Obsidian writes them now render. A bare
  `![[Some document.pdf]]` resolves by filename anywhere in the Vault, rather
  than only next to the note, so a vault using a single top-level attachments
  folder no longer shows broken images and PDFs. Note-relative paths keep
  working, a leading `/` reads from the Vault root, and where a filename is
  carried by several files the one nearest the note wins.
- First startup now makes each Vault browseable from its structure-only cache
  before vector embedding finishes. Model setup no longer launches a duplicate
  legacy single-Vault index that held the shared SQLite writer for the entire
  embedding pass.
- Existing-Git remote synchronization now selects the unique repository remote
  matching the Vault's configured HTTPS URL instead of assuming `origin`, so an
  unrelated operator-owned SSH `origin` no longer blocks a migrated Vault.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes — action required on upgrade
- **A read-only MCP token can no longer upload attachments over HTTP.** The
  multipart attachment endpoint now accepts an MCP bearer token only while MCP
  and MCP writes are both currently enabled. Previously it accepted that token
  whenever MCP was enabled, including in read-only mode, while the
  `import_attachment` MCP tool already refused: the same credential performing
  the same action got two different answers depending on which surface it came
  through. Disabling MCP, or MCP write mode, is now an immediate revocation of
  that credential's upload capability, checked per request.
  Unaffected: the web bearer token, which still works regardless of MCP write
  mode; the web UI's own paste and drop upload, which uses it; and deployments
  with no token configured, where the route stays open as before.
  **Action:** if an agent uploads attachments over HTTP using the MCP bearer
  token, either enable MCP write mode or move that workflow to the web bearer
  token. Call `get_attachment_import_config` to see the methods and limits
  currently available to a session.
- **A single-Vault deployment is imported into a Vault collection on first
  start.** Your existing vault becomes the first Vault in a registry Hatchdoor
  stores alongside the cache, and the per-vault environment variables it was
  configured with (`HATCHDOOR_EXCLUDE`, the `HATCHDOOR_GIT_*` family) are read
  once and stored as that Vault's own settings. Hatchdoor then serves a
  restricted recovery screen until those obsolete environment lines are removed
  and the container is restarted. They are
  per-Vault questions now, and a server-wide answer cannot survive a second
  Vault. Nothing on disk moves and no note is touched; the import only writes
  the registry. If it cannot be proven safe, Hatchdoor starts and says what
  stopped it rather than guessing.
  **Action:** leave the variables in place for the first upgraded start, then
  remove the variables named by Hatchdoor and start it again. Change them in
  Settings instead, per Vault.
- **Hatchdoor will not activate Vaults while imported per-Vault settings are
  still set in the environment.** Once your Vault owns them, an `.env` value does nothing:
  the file and the running server disagree, and every later change made in
  Settings looks overridden by a line that has no effect. Rather than ignore
  them quietly, Hatchdoor stops and names each one. `VAULT_PATH` is exempt,
  since Compose sets it on every deployment.
  **Action:** start once so the import runs, then delete the named
  `HATCHDOOR_GIT_*` and `HATCHDOOR_EXCLUDE` lines from your `.env` and start
  again.

### Added
- **Hatchdoor holds more than one Vault.** Add, pause, and disconnect Vaults
  from Settings, then browse them together or one at a time. A single-Vault
  install is unchanged: the collection interface appears only once there is a
  collection to show.
- **A Vault can be backed by Git.** Connect a repository you already have,
  clone one for Hatchdoor to manage, or keep local history inside a folder you
  own. Remotes that need one take an access token, and a sync console reports
  what actually happened rather than a status light.
- A **New note** button now sits at the bottom of the sidebar, always reachable
  without scrolling. The per-folder `+` stays for creating in a specific folder.
- A **changes panel**, opened from the sidebar rail, listing notes that changed
  on disk. It replaces the old "Last Modified" sidebar list. It deliberately
  carries no unread count yet: Hatchdoor cannot currently tell an agent's write
  from your own, and a count that ticked up every time you saved a note would
  mean the opposite of what it should.
- Recently viewed is now collapsible, and remembers whether you folded it away.

### Changed
- **The sidebar says what you are browsing.** A Scope zone at the top switches
  between one Vault and all of them, each row ending in a note count or the
  reason there is no count to give. On phones it moves into the topbar as a
  scope row and a bottom sheet, since the sidebar is a drawer there.
- **The explorer becomes a per-Vault accordion when you browse everything**,
  one Vault unfolded at a time. Narrow to a single Vault and the accordion
  disappears: a collection of one is just a vault.
- **The graph draws every Vault as its own labelled island** in one field,
  rather than merging separate collections into a single cloud of dots.
- **Search filters by Vault without changing what you are browsing.** A rail
  beside the results on desktop, a Scope field on phones. It narrows only the
  results in front of you, changes no ranking, and is forgotten when the dialog
  closes.
- **Search says so when a Vault could not answer**, naming it instead of
  quietly returning fewer results as though that were all there was.
- **Settings is the collection.** Every Vault is a section in the settings
  index, beside the sections that belong to the server itself.
- **The sidebar is restructured into three zones**: a fixed rail of whole-vault
  destinations at top, the scrolling note navigation in the middle, and the
  create action pinned at the bottom. Only the middle scrolls.
- **Stats and Graph moved** out of the sidebar header into that rail, as icons.
  Settings sits alongside them and is now a live link.
- Notes in the tree now carry a small index, so note rows and folder rows no
  longer look identical.
- The topbar's `···` menu on desktop is left-aligned sentence case with
  borderless rows, grouped into create/edit, utilities, and destructive actions
  — with Archive and Delete last. Mobile already looked like this; desktop did
  not.
- Interface icons are now Material Symbols Sharp rather than typed unicode
  characters, so they render consistently across platforms. Attribution is in
  the new `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- The note **Properties** heading is now the disclosure itself; the separate
  Show/Hide button is gone.
- **The create-note dialog is rebuilt.** Labels are distinguishable from the
  fields, the fields are actually visible, the folder chooser is a dropdown with
  a "New folder…" option instead of a free-text box beside a wall of chips, and
  a live line shows the path you are about to create.

### Fixed
- The MCP server told agents to call `get_attachment_import_config` before
  uploading a file, but the Vault-scoping migration had removed the tool: an
  agent following the server's own instructions got "Unknown MCP tool". It is
  restored, now taking one `vault_id` and reporting the Vault-scoped upload
  path. It also reports the instance-wide write switch and the Vault's own
  mutation capability as separate fields, so an agent that cannot upload is
  told which of the two closed the door instead of guessing.
- An agent could not create its first Vault over MCP without guessing. The
  `source` and credential arguments of `create_vault` and `edit_vault` were
  advertised as bare objects described in a sentence, while the server rejects
  unknown fields: every guess came back as a rejection with nothing to correct
  against. Both now publish their real per-variant shapes, including which
  `mode` each source accepts, the poll-interval floor, and the fact that a
  managed Vault has no local-history mode.
- `edit_vault` replaces a Vault definition wholesale, so omitting a field
  cleared it. It said none of this; it now says to read the Vault from
  `list_vaults` and send back what you are not changing, and explains what
  `confirm_identity_change` consents to and that the Vault must be disabled
  first.
- `list_note_attachments` required MCP write mode, though it only reads. A
  read-only agent could not see what a note referenced without fetching the
  whole note. It is now a read tool, and works on Vaults that do not accept
  writes at all.
- Opening a note highlighted it in up to three sidebar lists at once. The
  highlight is now canonical in the folder tree only.
- Browsing no longer waits on the search index. A Vault's structure is
  published as soon as it is read, so you can open notes while its vectors are
  still being built.
- The explorer kept showing notes, and whole Vaults, after they had left the
  collection.
- A public demo deployment no longer reveals local filesystem paths, disabled
  Vaults, or notes on demoted layers.
- One unreadable file no longer fails the indexing run for the Vault
  containing it.

Your notes and folders are untouched, and the cache is not rebuilt. Two upgrade
notes apply: the one-time Vault import described above, which is automatic, and
the attachment authorization change, which matters only if an agent uploads over
HTTP with the MCP bearer token.

## v2.4.0 - 2026-07-27

### ⚠️ Breaking changes — action required on upgrade
- **The MCP attachment staging folder is removed.** Agents no longer import
  attachments by dropping a file into a shared, mounted inbox and calling
  `import_attachment` with a `staged_filename`. Instead, `import_attachment` now
  takes the file bytes directly as base64 (`content` + `target_relative_path`),
  and larger files use the existing multipart `POST /api/attachment`.
  **Action:** remove the `HATCHDOOR_MCP_ATTACHMENT_STAGING_PATH`,
  `HOST_ATTACHMENT_STAGING_PATH`, and `HATCHDOOR_MCP_ADVERTISE_HOST_PATHS`
  variables from your `.env`, and delete the attachments-inbox volume mount from
  your Docker Compose file. Any agent workflow that placed files in the inbox
  must switch to sending base64 via `import_attachment` (call
  `get_attachment_import_config` to see the methods and limits).
- **`HATCHDOOR_MCP_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` is renamed to
  `HATCHDOOR_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES`** (it caps the web UI and HTTP uploads, not
  just MCP). **Action:** rename it in your `.env` if you set it; otherwise the
  old name is ignored and the default (10 MiB) applies.
- **The cache schema is upgraded from 7 to 8 for vault layers.** The generated
  SQLite cache is rebuilt on the first startup after upgrade. Source Markdown is
  unchanged, but the initial indexing run re-embeds the vault.

### Added
- First-run semantic-search setup. Hatchdoor now asks the single user to accept
  the Gemma terms before downloading the default multilingual EmbeddingGemma
  model, shows model-download and indexing progress in the UI and logs, and
  keeps a local acceptance receipt with the persistent model files. Declining
  Gemma removes its partial files and starts the Nomic Embed Text v1.5 fallback;
  Nomic is explicitly identified as English-only and lower quality for
  multilingual vaults. Public images ship neither model.
- Direct attachment upload for agents: the `import_attachment` MCP tool accepts
  base64 file bytes inline (universal fallback for any MCP client), capped by the
  new `HATCHDOOR_MCP_MAX_BASE64_BYTES` (default 5 MiB, measured on the decoded
  file). `get_attachment_import_config` now enumerates both upload methods, their
  size limits, and which to use.
- Vault layers: add a `.hatchdoor-layer` marker to a folder to place its notes
  on a named, demoted surface. Browser routes remain default-surface only; MCP
  clients can explicitly select named layers.
- `HATCHDOOR_EXCLUDE` for comma-separated gitignore-style noise patterns,
  `HATCHDOOR_EMBED_LAYERS` to opt demoted layers out of vector embedding, and
  diagnostics via `GET /api/diagnostics` or the `layer_diagnostics` MCP tool.
- Layer-aware note-write and attachment responses, so automation can tell which
  surface a created, moved, archived, or uploaded item belongs to.
- Cross-platform inline previews for linked PDF vault assets, with internal PDF
  links resolving as vault assets rather than ordinary note links.

### Changed
- The `/mcp` request-body limit is raised to fit base64 attachment inflation so a
  legitimately sized upload is not rejected before the tool's own size check.
- `POST /api/attachment` now accepts the MCP bearer token as an alternative to
  the web bearer token, so an agent uploading larger files over HTTP can reuse
  its existing MCP credential instead of needing `HATCHDOOR_WEB_BEARER_TOKEN`
  provisioned separately. The rest of the web API is unaffected — this route
  was pulled out of the shared protected-routes group so the MCP token is not
  granted any broader access.
- Built-in noise exclusions now omit `.obsidian/`, `.trash/`,
  `.hatchdoor-trash/`, `.DS_Store`, `*.tmp`, and `*.sync-conflict-*` from the
  index. In particular, Markdown under `.obsidian/` or `.trash/` and Syncthing
  conflict copies are no longer searchable unless a deployment negates the
  relevant default with `HATCHDOOR_EXCLUDE`.
- FastEmbed is upgraded from v4 to v5. Each chunk is now embedded with its note
  title and heading path as context, improving retrieval relevance while
  preserving chunk-level search results.

## v2.3.0 - 2026-07-19

### Added
- The UI is now available during initial indexing and shows live token-weighted progress, note/chunk counts, and a measured ETA while vault and MCP data remain unavailable until the index commits.
- Indexing logs a human-readable heartbeat every minute and detailed performance diagnostics at debug level.
- MCP `search_notes` now supports exact tag, path-prefix, property-existence, and typed property-equality filters with explicit property projection.
- Added the metadata-only `query_notes` MCP tool and structured tags, aliases, and frontmatter properties to `get_note`.

### Changed
- Chunks are embedded individually to avoid batch-longest padding and reduce peak memory pressure.
- The cache schema is upgraded to version 6 for note-level frontmatter metadata. The first 2.3.0 startup automatically rebuilds the generated SQLite cache from the Markdown vault.
- Rust and frontend dependencies are refreshed within their current compatibility lines, including git2 0.21, resolving the current RustSec and npm audit findings.

## v2.1.1 - 2026-06-13

Security, performance, and operational hardening from the 2026-06-11 codebase audit, plus an iOS PWA download fix.

### Fixed
- Markdown downloads no longer arrive as HTML on iOS standalone PWAs. The service worker's SPA navigation fallback was intercepting `/api/*`, `/vault-assets/*`, and `/health` navigations (iOS ignores the `<a download>` attribute and treats the click as a navigation) and serving the cached `index.html`. Added a `navigateFallbackDenylist` so those requests reach the network.

### Security
- Added optional web API authentication: when `HATCHDOOR_WEB_BEARER_TOKEN` is set, all `/api/*` routes, `/vault-assets/*`, and note downloads require the token (via `Authorization: Bearer` header or `access_token` query parameter). The PWA prompts for the token on a 401. (F-01)
- Changed the default bind host to `127.0.0.1`; exposing on `0.0.0.0` is now an explicit opt-in documented to require auth or a reverse proxy. (F-01)
- Coalesced concurrent `/api/refresh` requests so a request loop can no longer trigger overlapping full reindexes. (F-02)
- Compared bearer tokens (MCP and web) in constant time. (F-06)
- Served SVG vault assets with `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` and `Content-Disposition: attachment` to neutralize script execution on direct navigation. (F-09)
- Stopped leaking absolute filesystem paths and raw internal error strings in HTTP error bodies; details now go to logs only. (F-10)
- Capped `POST /api/resolve-batch` at 200 targets. (F-11)

### Performance
- Moved vault reindexing, embedding, and query embedding off the async runtime via `spawn_blocking`, holding the cache write lock only for the final swap so reads no longer freeze during a refresh. (F-03)
- MCP write tools now resolve the target note from the SQLite cache instead of rebuilding the full vault index from disk on every write. (F-04)
- Enabled SQLite WAL mode and added a pooled set of read connections so concurrent reads run in parallel instead of serializing on a single mutex. (F-05)

### Correctness & operations
- Validated `McpConfig` once at startup (failing fast when write mode is enabled without a bearer token) instead of re-parsing the environment on every MCP request. (F-07)
- Git sync now refuses to force-checkout over uncommitted manual edits to tracked vault files, surfacing them as an error instead of silently discarding them. (F-08)
- Moved the hard-coded `90-archive/` prefix to `HATCHDOOR_ARCHIVE_PREFIX`. (F-12)
- Added a CI workflow (fmt, clippy, test for the backend; lint, typecheck, test, build for the frontend) and a Docker Compose `healthcheck`. (F-13)
- The SSE vault-events stream now emits the current revision on broadcast lag instead of silently dropping it, so a slow client always resyncs. (F-16)
- `/health` now runs a `SELECT 1` against the cache so it reports unhealthy if the database is unreachable, and the binary gained a `--healthcheck` mode for the container probe. (F-17)

## v2.1.0 - 2026-06-xx

### Added
- Optional automatic git sync of the vault: successful MCP write tools commit and push changes to the configured remote with debounced batching, conflict-abort semantics, and an immediate flush of stranded commits on startup.
- `get_git_sync_status` MCP tool and a git-sync warning on write-tool responses.

### Changed
- Richer git sync status reporting with plural-aware commit messages.

### Fixed
- Enabled the git2 `https` feature for TLS remote transport.
- The vault watcher now ignores `.git/` so sync churn does not trigger reindexing.

## v2.0.0 - 2026-xx-xx

### Added
- SQLite read model (FTS5 + sqlite-vec embeddings) backing the vault index, with chunking, embedding, and hybrid/semantic/keyword retrieval.
- Streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint exposing read tools always and write tools (create/update/edit/replace-section/append/move/rename/delete notes and attachments) gated by env flag and bearer token.

### Changed
- Pinned the Rust toolchain to 1.96.0 and reformatted the tree.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-02-20

Compared with `v1.0.0`.

### Added
- Added a `Download .md` action in the note actions menu.
- Added a server download endpoint: `GET /api/note/{slug}/download`.

### Changed
- Switched markdown download flow to server-driven delivery for native mobile handoff.
- Updated frontend download trigger to use an anchor `download` flow instead of popup navigation.
- Added UTF-8-aware filename handling in `Content-Disposition` for markdown downloads.

### Fixed
- Improved iOS/Safari file handoff behavior for `.md` downloads by using attachment headers.
- Added and updated frontend/backend tests for the download path and response headers.
