 * The editor that replaces one rendered block while it is being edited.
 *
 * It is a CodeMirror instance rather than a textarea so markdown can be styled
 * as it is typed: `**word**` shows bold with its asterisks still visible. A
 * textarea cannot style part of its own text, and the usual workaround, a
 * styled mirror layer behind transparent text, does not survive contact with
 * bold, whose glyphs are wider than the regular ones the invisible text is
 * measured in. The caret would drift out of line with what is on screen.
 *
 * CodeMirror also owns the things that are easy to get wrong by hand and
 * invisible until someone hits them: IME composition, the mobile virtual
 * keyboard, selection, and undo inside a block.
 *
 * Structural editing is deliberately not CodeMirror's. Enter, Backspace at the
 * start, Tab and the arrow keys are bound to the same block operations as
 * before, which are pure functions over the whole document. CodeMirror only
 * ever edits the one block it holds.
