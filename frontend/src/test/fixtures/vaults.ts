/**
 * Shared multi-Vault test fixtures (#137). One, three, and eight Vaults, plus
 * a builder for each non-healthy per-Vault condition the `/api/v1/vaults/**`
 * API can report — the count-or-condition slot vocabulary the design spec
 * (#116, amended by #117) settles: healthy, indexing, stale, sync failed,
 * sync stopped, conflict, and unavailable. #137 builds no chrome that renders
 * these; this module exists so #114-#126's own tests have realistic,
 * consistently-shaped wire data to assert against without each re-deriving
 * it. `git_error`/`search_error`/`activation_error` codes below are
 * plausible placeholders for conditions not yet exercised by any shipped
 * route (Git sync/conflict reporting is #121's own ticket) — confirm the
 * exact backend `code` string against `src/git/**` when a ticket first
 * renders that specific condition; the shape (`VaultRuntimeError`) is what
 * matters here, not the string literal.
